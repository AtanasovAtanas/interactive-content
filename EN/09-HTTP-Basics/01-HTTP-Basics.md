# HTTP Basics

**HTTP** is the main Internet protocol used to communicate between:

- **Web servers:** which host Web sites and server-side software components

- **Web clients:** such as Web browsers and mobile apps, which display the information to the users and interact with them.

HTTP comes from **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol** and It is a protocol originally created for transferring `HTML`, `CSS`, images and other Web resources within the global distributed information system called **World Wide Web** (or just Web).

**The Web** consists of all Web sites in **Internet**, which are accessed via the **HTTP protocol**.

Later, HTTP was extended to a **general-purpose client-server protocol for the Internet** and was widely used for transferring almost anything over Internet: text, images, documents, audio streaming, video streaming, chat messages and many others.

There are different kinds of **protocols**:

- a **communication protocol** is a set of rules, which define how two or more parties are talking to each other. It defines the format of the messages exchanged and their semantics

- programming Protocols are `languages`, used to communicate between machines. Like in the human languages, protocols have syntax, which specifies the structure of commands and semantics, which specifies their meaning.

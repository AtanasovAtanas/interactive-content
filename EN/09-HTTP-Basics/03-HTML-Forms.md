# HTML Forms: Action

``` java
<form action="home.html">
  <input type="submit" value="Go to homepage"/>
</form>
```

In HTML forms the `action` attribute defines where to submit the form data.

Most HTML forms have the `form` tag with some action URL, a set of input fields and a submit button.

The **submit button** sends the form data to the specified URL in the `action` attribute.

You can use relative or full URL:

- Relative URLs are evaluated relative to the current URL, which is loaded in the Web browser

- Full URLs are used to submit the form data to a completely different Web site

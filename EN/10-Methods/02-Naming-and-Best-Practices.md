# Naming Methods

Methods always should be verbs.

They represent an action and the method name should clearly state the action they perform.

The method name can be a single or 2-3 words as needed to represent the action.

## Example for good names

Method names should answer the question:

`What does this method do?`

* Good method names: `findStudent`, `getReportByName`, `getId`.

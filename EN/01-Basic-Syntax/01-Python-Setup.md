# Creating a Console App
You will have to set an interpreter. This is a computer program that executes instructions written in a programming language (like Python), without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

Now, create a new project and choose an existing interpreter, as shown on the pictures below.

# Running a Simple Console App
First, you need to create a new **Python File** in the **root directory**.

[image assetsSrc="pycharm-new-python-file.png" /]
[image assetsSrc="pycharm-new-python-file-pop-up.png" /]

Then, type in the following code in your newly created project in PyCharm:
```python live
print('Hello World!')
```

[image assetsSrc="pycharm-hello-world.png" /]

When you are ready, you can run the console app using:
 - `Right click` -> `Run "helloworld"`
 - `Ctrl + Shift + F10`

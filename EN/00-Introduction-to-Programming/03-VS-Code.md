# Development Environments (IDE)
In order to program we need an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). 

**An environment for development** (Integrated Development Environment – **IDE**) is a combination of traditional tools for development of software applications. 

In the development environment we write code, compile and execute the programs. Development environments integrate in them a text editor for writing code, a programming language, a compiler or an interpreter and a runtime environment for executing programs, a debugger for tracking the program and seeking out errors, tools for user interface design and other tools and add-ons.

**Environments for development** are convenient, because they integrate everything necessary for the development of the program, without the need to exit the environment. 

If we don't use an environment for development, we will have to write the code in a text editor, to compile it with a command on the console, to run it with another command on the console and to write more additional commands when needed, which is very time consuming. 

For programming with **the JavaScript language** the most commonly used IDE is **Visual Studio Code**, which is developed and distributed freely by Microsoft and can be downloaded from: https://code.visualstudio.com

Alternatives of Visual Studio Code are:
- WebStorm – https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download
- Atom – https://atom.io
- NetBeans – https://netbeans.org/downloads/
- Visual Studio - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Eclipse – https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

In this course, we are going to use the development environment **Visual Studio Code**. 

This an example how a development IDE may look (the Visual Studio Code IDE for JavaScript):

# Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code
We need **Node.js** so that we can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
* server-side JS runtime.

You can download it from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Select your OS and go on with installing.

Let's continue with the installation of the integrated environment **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**.

Installing later versions of Visual Studio Code should be very similar.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is distributed freely by Microsoft and can be downloaded from: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 

The installation is typical for Windows with `[Next]`, `[Next]` and `[Finish]`.

The next lines describe in detail the steps for the installation of Visual Studio Code. 

After we download the installation file and start it, the following screen appears:
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-js/blob/master/assets/intro-to-programming-install-vscode-1.png"/]

Press the `[Next]` button and you will see the screen bellow:
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-js/blob/master/assets/intro-to-programming-install-vscode-2.png"/]

You can choose a destination location or leave the default one. Then press the `[Next]` button again.

Now we have to select Start Menu Folder. 

The next step is to put check marks on the these tasks:

VS is now ready for installation. Press the `[Install]` button. Basically this is everything.
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-js/blob/master/assets/intro-to-programming-install-vscode-5.png"/]

Installation of Visual Studio begins, and a screen like the one bellow will appear:
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-js/blob/master/assets/intro-to-programming-install-vscode-6.png"/]

After Visual Studio is installed, an informative screen will appear. Press the `[Launch]` button to start it.
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-js/blob/master/assets/intro-to-programming-install-vscode-7.png"/]

Upon **starting VS Code** the main view of Visual Studio Code is displayed.

That's all. You are ready to work with Visual Studio Code.

# Development Environments: Desktop and Online
Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code

* https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* You can use an older version, but it is not recommended

Alternative IDE (online)

* JavaScript: directly use the browser console (press \[F12\] key)
* C#: https://dotnetfiddle.net
* Java: https://compilejava.net 
* Python: https://repl.it

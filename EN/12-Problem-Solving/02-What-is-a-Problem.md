# What is a Problem?

[image assetsSrc="what-is-a-problem1.png" /]

By definition, in our daily life, the problem is a **question**, **situation**, or a **puzzle**, requiring logical thought to find a solution.

In physics and mathematics, a problem is a **task that starts with certain conditions** and aims to find, calculate, or demonstrate a fact, result or law.

In **programming** a problem is an assignment to design an **algorithm** and **implement** it by writing code to fulfill certain tasks.

This task could take an **input**, **processing** it, and producing an **output**, or building an **application**, **website**, or software component.

Problems have goals.

Goals are what you wish to **achieve**, the final situation, product or result.

When the **goals are achieved**, the problem is considered solved.

In math and physics, the goals are to obtain certain **result** or prove or demonstrate something **logically**.

In programming, the goals are to **design and write a working code**, which corresponds to the assignment and its requirements.

Problems may have some **barriers**, which are obstacles that prevent the achievement of the goals.

Barriers might be a shortage of resources or absence of knowledge or skills to achieve the goals.

The solution to the problem describes how to overcome the barriers.

Without goals and barriers, there is no problem.

The problem is the **assignment** to achieve, **solve**, **build** or **calculate** something by overcoming the barriers.

# Tech Problem-Solving Skills

**Tech problem-solving skills** are what software engineers need to develop in order to be successful in their profession.

Without strong **algorithmic** thinking and problem solving, a developer will be a **low performer**, who cannot grow much in the career.

Tech problem-solving is the ability to think logically and solve tech problems.

To be able to design **algorithms**, software engineers need to develop algorithmic thinking, which is also called `logical thinking`, `mathematical thinking`, or `engineering thinking`.

The algorithm (the steps to get the result) is encoded as a sequence of commands or programming statements in the code.

Tech problem-solving skills can be **developed** by solving a **few thousand practical programming problems**.

It is not **required** to have strong math skills to become a software developer, but it can help you learn faster because math skills include tech problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

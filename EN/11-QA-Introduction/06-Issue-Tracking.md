# Issue Tracking

## Definition
Issue Tracking is a **process** in which there is a status and it says who the bug is **assigned** to. Once the bug is fixed, its status changes to **fixed**. Finally, when QA validates the problem and everything is fine tells us that Issue's status is closed. Also, using **Issue Tracker** we can communicate with the person who logged the problem, ask them additional information.

## Issue Description

Each issue (bug / defect) should hold the following information:

* **Title** - Cannot register user "maria"
* **Description** - Registering with user "maria" and password "m1RI@" fails with message..
* **Screenshots** - Screenshots of the problem and file attachments
* **Status**: - Assigned (assigned to a certain developer for investigation)
* **Owner** - Peter (the developer who currently works on this issue)
* **Comments** - People can discuss and comment the issue
* **Priority** - Critical, High, Average, Low
* **Example**: [here](http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/2463)

## Issue Trackers

An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer software package that **manages and maintains** lists of issues. Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settingsâ€”especially in large or distributed collaborations, but can also be **employed by individuals** as part of a time management or personal productivity regime. These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry.

Many issue tracking systems are available:
* [TRAC](http://trac.edgewall.org)
* [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org)
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [GitHubIssueTracker](https://github.com/issues)

# Definition

**Computer software**, or simply **software**, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In **computer science** and **software engineering**, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes **computer programs**, **libraries** and related non-executable data, such as **online documentation** or **digital media**. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

# Software Development Cycle

Software Development Life Cycle (**SDLC**) is a process followed for a software project, within a **software organization**. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to **develop**, **maintain**, **replace** and **alter** or **enhance** specific software. The life cycle defines a **methodology** for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

## Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis is the **most important** and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the **senior members** of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the **economical**, **operational** and **technical** areas.

Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the **risks** associated with the project is also done in the **planning stage**. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with **minimum risks**.

## Stage 2: Defining Requirements

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly **define** and **document** the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an **SRS** (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be **designed** and **developed** during the project life cycle.

## Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture

SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually **more than one design approach** for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as **risk assessment**, **product robustness**, **design modularity**, **budget** and **time constraints**, the best design approach is selected for the product.

## Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product

In this stage of SDLC the **actual development** starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like **compilers**, **interpreters**, **debuggers**, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages such as **C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP** are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.

## Stage 5: Testing the Product

This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the **testing only stage of the product** where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.

## Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the **business strategy** of that organization. The product may first be released in a **limited segment** and tested in the real business environment (UAT- User acceptance testing).

Then based on the feedback, the product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in the targeting market segment. After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.

# Retail Software

Retail software is computer software typically installed on **PC-type computers** or more recently (past 2005) delivered via the Internet (also known as cloud-based). Traditionally this software was delivered via **physical data storage media** sold to end consumer but very few companies still provide their software using physical media. The software is typically sold under restricted licenses (e.g. EULAs) or in the case of cloud-based software sold as a Software-as-a-Service (**SaaS**) model.

## Types

* Cloud based-software - this is software that is not installed on a user's device but delivered on-demand via the **Internet** to the end user's device(s) either through web-based apps or native apps (iOS and Android). Most new software companies provide both or a combination of web, and native apps which may provide different functionality depending on the actual user in a client company.

* OEM Pack - This is a licensed copy of software given by the software manufacturer to a **computer** **manufacturer** to pre-install on a computer being sold to a customer. A backup copy may or may not be provided on a **CD** to the end-user along with the computer.

* Box Pack - This is a **licensed** **copy** of the software that an end-user buys off the shelf from any authorized retail outlet. They may sometimes be more **highly-priced** than OEM versions as you generally get additional software along with the main software within the pack.

* Paper Licence - This is a scheme provided by the software manufacturer to companies or businesses that require **many** **copies** of particular software to be installed on multiple computers within the organization (Volume license key). Say, for example, a company requires installing software on 50 computers in its office. Instead of buying 50 CDs and managing those 50 individually, the company can buy one copy of the software and request the software vendor to issue a **paper** **license** authorizing them to use it on **50** **computers**. The software vendor then charges them accordingly. This method is also **much** **cheaper** than buying 50 individual packs.

# Web Applications

A web application (or web app) is an application software that runs on a **web** **server**, unlike computer-based software programs that are stored locally on the Operating System (OS) of the device. Web applications are accessed by the user through a **web** **browser** with an **active** **internet** **connection**. These applications are programmed using a client–server modeled structure—the **user** **client** is provided services through an off-site server that is hosted by a third-party. Examples of commonly-used, web applications, include: **web-mail**, **online** **retail** **sales**, **online** **banking**, and **online** **auctions**.

# Mobile Applications

There are **several** **ways** of targeting mobile devices when making a web application:

* **Responsive** **web** **design** can be used to make a web application - whether a **conventional** **website** or a single-page application viewable on **small** **screens** that works well with touchscreens

* **Progressive** **Web** **Apps** (PWA) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as **working** **offline** and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications

* **Native** **apps** or "**mobile** **apps**" run directly on a mobile device, just as a conventional software application runs directly on a desktop computer, without a web browser (and potentially without the need for Internet connectivity)

* **Hybrid** **apps** embed a web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework. This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of **native** **apps** (e.g. direct access to **device** **hardware**, **offline** **operation**, app store visibility). Hybrid app frameworks include **Apache** **Cordova**, **Electron**, **Haxe**, **React** **Native** and **Xamarin**

# Lists Overview

Just like an array Ð° **List** is a **sequence of elements**.

The main difference between them is that the size of an array cannot be resized.

For example if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one, while elements can be **added** and **removed** from the **List** whenever you want.

The main **features** of the **Lists** are:

- Lists can store **objects** of any types(Integer, Double, String, etc.)
- Elements are numbered from **0** to **size-1**
- The **size** of the **List** is **expandable**
- A list supports a lot of useful **methods**

## Position Property

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element:
* Static;
* Relative;
* Absolute;
* Fixed;
* Sticky.

When the `position` property is set, the elements are positioned using the **top, bottom, left,** and **right** properties. 
 
These properties also work differently **depending on the position value**.

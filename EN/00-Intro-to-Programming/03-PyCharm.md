# Development Environments (IDE)
In order to program we need an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). 

**An environment for development** (Integrated Development Environment – **IDE**) is a combination of traditional tools for development of software applications. 

In the development environment we write code, compile and execute the programs. Development environments integrate in them a text editor for writing code, a programming language, a compiler or an interpreter and a runtime environment for executing programs, a debugger for tracking the program and seeking out errors, tools for user interface design and other tools and add-ons.

**Environments for development** are convenient, because they integrate everything necessary for the development of the program, without the need to exit the environment. 

If we don't use an environment for development, we will have to write the code in a text editor, to compile it with a command on the console, to run it with another command on the console and to write more additional commands when needed, which is very time consuming. 

For programming with **the Python language** the most commonly used IDE is **PyCharm**.

For the purposes of this course we are going to use the **Community** version, which is developed and distributed freely by JetBrains and can be downloaded from: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

**Alternatives** of PyCharm are:
- Sublime Text 3 – https://www.sublimetext.com/3
- Atom – https://atom.io/
- Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com
- Spyder – https://www.spyder-ide.org/

This an example how a development IDE may look (the PyCharm IDE for Python):

# Installing PyCharm
We begin with the installation of the integrated environment **PyCharm** (Community). 

Installing later versions of PyCharm should be very similar.

The **Community** version of PyCharm is distributed freely by JetBrains and can be downloaded from: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

The installation is typical for Windows with `[Next]`, `[Next]` and `[Finish]`.

The next lines describe in detail the steps for the installation of PyCharm (Community). 

After we download the installation file and start it, the following screen appears:

Press the `[Next]` button and you will see the screen bellow:

A screen with the installation options of PyCharm is being loaded.

Put a check mark on `[.py]`, `[Download and install JRE x86 by JetBrains]` buttons. Click `[Next]`. 

Now we have to choose a Start Menu Folder. Next we click `[Install]`. Basically, this is everything.

After PyCharm is installed, an informative screen will appear. Press the `[Run PyCharm Community Edition]` button to start it.

Upon **starting PyCharm** a screen appears like the one bellow.

That's all. You are ready to work with PyCharm.

# Explorer and Projects in PyCharm
PyCharm **explorer** hold projects. The shortcut you can use to access it is `[Alt + 1]`.

It is mostly used to browse through your solutiuon from different viewpoints. It also allows you to create new items such as directiories, files, classes and more.

The tool window lets you open files in the editor, navigate to a particular code fragment and so on.

The **project** holds source code files: **.py files**

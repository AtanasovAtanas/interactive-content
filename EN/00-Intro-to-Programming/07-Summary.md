# Summary

- First, we have learned what is programming – **giving commands, written in a computer language, which the machine understands and is able to execute**.
- We understood what a computer program is – it represents a sequence of commands, arranged one after another. - We got familiar with the language for programming **Java** on a base level and how to create simple console applications with **IntelliJ IDEA**.
- We followed the structure of the programming code in the Java language, as for example, the fact that commands are mainly given in the section `public static void main(String[] args)` between the opening and closing curly parentheses.
- We saw how to print with `System.out.println(…)` and how to start our program with `[Ctrl + Shift + F10]`.

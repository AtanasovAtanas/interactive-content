 # Character Classes

  In the **context of regular expressions**, a character class is a **set of characters enclosed within square brackets**. 

  It specifies the **characters** that will **successfully match** a **single character** from a given **input string**.

- Simple Class - a set of characters side-by-side within square brackets:
  - `[abc]`->  matches any character that is either a, b or c: **a**lph**ab**eti**c**

- Negation - 
  - `[^abc]` - matches any character that is not a, b or c: a**lph**ab**eti**c

- Ranges - 
  - `[0-9]` - character **range** matches any digit from 0 to 9: John is **8** years old.

# Files and Paths
A Java **Path** instance represents **a path in the file system**.

A path can point to either a **file** or a **directory**.

**Path** is used to **examine**, **locate**, and **manipulate** files.

An example of that is input.txt file wich we have used for the previous problems.

```java
String input = "D:\\input.txt";

Path path = Paths.get(input);
```
The static method `get()` takes as argument the **String representation of the file location**.

By calling a `Paths.get()` - method the **instance of Path** is created.

The Path instance gives us an easy way to create a Buffered Stream by using a BufferedReader and **Files** classes.

Let's see the following example:

```java
Path path = Paths.get("D:\\input.txt");

try (BufferedReader inputStream = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {

    String line = inputStream.readLine();
    while (line != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
        line = inputStream.readLine();
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
By calling a `newBufferedReader()` - method of the Files class and pass the path as a argument, the BufferedReader instance is created (**Buffered Stream**).

The following example illustrates copying the content of one file to another:

```java
Path inputPath = Paths.get("D:\\input.txt");
Path outputPath = Paths.get("D:\\output.txt");

try  {
    List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(inputPath);
    Files.write(outputPath, lines);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
First we create two Path variables for input and output files.

Next we call `readallLines()` - method of the Files class and pass the **inputPath** variable.

The `readAllLines()` - method, returns a List with all lines in a file.

Then we pass this **List** and the **outputPath** variable to the Files `write()` - method.

try {

# File Class in Java

Java File class represents the files and directory pathnames in an abstract manner.

This class is used for creation of files and directories, file searching, file deletion, etc.

The File object represents the actual file/directory on the disk. 

- Creating a File object, by placing the String representation of the file location in the constructor:
```java
File file = new File("D:\\input.txt");
```
- Some of the useful **methods** of the **File** class are:

| **Method** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `exists()` | Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists. Returns true if and only if the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists; false otherwise. |
| `length()` | Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname. The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory. |
| `isDirectory()` | Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory. Returns true if and only if the file denoted by this abstract pathname exists and is a directory; false otherwise. |
| `listFiles()` | Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname. |

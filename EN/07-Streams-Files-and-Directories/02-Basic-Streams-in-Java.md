# Byte Streams

Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes.

Byte streams are the lowest level streams there are.

Their main characteristic is that they can read or write only one byte at a time. 

All of the byte streams descend from the InputStream and the OutputStream classes.

Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.

- Ð¢he InputStream is a sequence of bytes finishing with -1, which is a special character marking the end of the file.

- The OutputStream is consisted only of bytes, which will be written.

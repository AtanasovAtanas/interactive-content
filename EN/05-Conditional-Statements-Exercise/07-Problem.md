## Description
A pool with **volume V** has **two pipes** that fill it. 

**Every pipe has certain flow** (liters water that going through a single pipe per hour). 

The worker turns on the pipes **at the same time** and goes out for **N hours**. 

Write a program that shows the condition of the pool **at the moment the worker comes back**.

## Input
**Four** lines of input:
- **V** - **The volume of the pool in liters** - integer in range \[1…10000\]
- **P1** - **flow of the first pipe per hour** - integer in range \[1…5000\]
- **P2** - **flow of the second pipe per hour** - integer in range \[1…5000\]
- **H** - **hours the worker is missing** - float-pointing number in range \[1.0…24.00\]

## Output
Print on the console **one of both possibilities**:
- How far the pool has been filled and which pipe how much contributed in percentage
  - "The pool is \{occupancy of the pool in percent\}% full. Pipe 1: \{percent water from the first pipe\}%. Pipe 2: \{percent water from the second pipe\}%."
- If the pool is overflowing – how many liters are overflowed for the given time
  - "For \{hours pipes are filling the pool\} hours the pool overflows with \{liters water overflow\} liters."
- All numbers in the output should be formatted to 2nd digit after the decimal point.

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1000 | The pool is 66.00% full. Pipe 1: 45.45%. Pipe 2: 54.55%. |
| 100 | |
| 120 | |
| 3 | |

### Comments
- For 3 hours: The first pipe fills up 300 liters
- The second pipe fills up 360 liters
- In total – 660 l < 1000 l => 66% are filled up
- The first pipe is contributed with 45% (300 of 660 liters).
- The second pipe is contributed with 54% (360 of 660 liters).

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 100 | For 2.50 hours the pool overflows with 400.00 liters. |
| 100 | |
| 100 | |
| 2.5 | |

### Comments
- For 2.5 hours: The first pipe fills up 250 l 
- The second pipe fills up 250 l
- In total – 500 l > 100 l => 400 l are overflowed.

# Description
**For a period of time, patients are arriving every day** in the hospital for examination. 

It has initially **7** doctors. 

Each doctor can only review **one patient per day**, but sometimes there is a shortage of doctors, so other patients are sent to other hospitals. 

**Every third day** the hospital makes calculations and **if the number of unreviewed patients is greater than the number of reviewed, one more doctor is appointed**. 

As the **appointment of the doctor occurs before the intake of patients for the day**. 

Write a program that calculates the number of reviewed and unreviewed patients for the given period.

# Input

The input is read from the console and contains: 

- **The period** for which you need to perform calculations - integer in range \[1... 1000\] 
- On the **following lines (equal to the number of days)** – the number of patients arriving for review for the current day - integer in range \[0... 10 000\]

# Output
Print on the console 2 lines:
- First line: "Treated patients: \{Number of patients reviewed\}." 
- Second line: "Untreated patients: \{Number of unreviewed patients\}."

# Example

| **Input** | | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | | Treated patients: 23. |
| 7 | | Untreated patients: 21. |
| 27 | | |
| 9 | | |
| 1 | | |

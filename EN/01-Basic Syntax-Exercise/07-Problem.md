## Description
Your task is to calculate the **total price of a purchase** from a vending machine.

Until you receive "**Start**" you will be given different coins that are being inserted in the machine. 
 
You have to **sum** them in order to have the **total money inserted**. 
 
There is a problem though. Your vending machine only works with **0.1**, **0.2**, **0.5**, **1**, and **2 coins**. 
 
If someone **tries to insert some other coins** you have to **display** "Cannot accept \{money\}", where the value is **formated** to the **second** digit after the decimal point and not add it to the total money. 
 
On the next few lines until you receive **"End"** you will be **given products** to purchase. 
 
Your machine has however only **"Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke"**. The prices are: **2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0** respectively. 
 
If the person tries to purchase a **not existing product print “Invalid product”**. 
 
Be careful that the person may **try** to **purchase** a product for which he **doesn't have money**. 
 
In that case **print "Sorry, not enough money"**. 
 
If the person purchases a product **successfully** print "Purchased \{product name\}". 
 
After the **"End"** command print the money that are left **formatted** to the **second** decimal point in the format "Change: \{money left\}".

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Cannot accept 0.60 |
| 1 | Purchased Coke |
| 0.5 | Purchased Soda |
| 0.6 | Sorry, not enough money |
| Start | Change: 0.70 |
| Coke | |
| Soda | |
| Crisps | |
| End | |

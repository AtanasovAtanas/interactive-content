**GitHub** is the **most used** site for **developers** to upload their projectsâ€™ **source code**.

It is an **online platform** where you can **host** your **repositories**.

There are many **separate developers** and **companies** that use it.

You can use it **completely free**, although some **premium features require payment**.

Your **repositories** are **independent** of **GitHub**, they are just **hosted** there.

You can **create a new repository** via **GitBash** and **host** it on **GitHub**, or create it **directly** from **GitHub**.

We advise you to **upload** your **projects** on **GitHub** so that people can check them out.

What is more, it can be used as your **portfolio** when **applying for a job**.

GitHub provides you a **project board**, where you can **log tasks** which have to be completed.

It follows the **Kanban style**, which is an **agile project management tool**, designed to help **visualize work**, **limit** work-in-progress, and **maximize efficiency**.

**Kanban boards** use **cards** and **columns** to manage tasks.

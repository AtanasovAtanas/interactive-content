# Queue Functionality

A Queue is a "First In First Out" - **FIFO** data structure. 
It models a **queue** in **real-life**, you might have seen in front of a cinema, a shopping mall, a metro, or a bus.

Just like queues in real life, **new elements** in a Queue data structure are added **at the back** and **removed from the front**. 

Queues provide the following functionality:

- Adding an element at the end of the queue

[image assetsSrc="queue-example(1).png" /]
    
- Removing the first element from the queue

[image assetsSrc="queue-example(1).png" /]

- Getting the first element of the queue without removing it

[image assetsSrc="queue-example(1).png" /]

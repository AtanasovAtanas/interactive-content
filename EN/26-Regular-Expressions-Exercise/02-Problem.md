## Description
Write a program that processes information about a race.

On the **first line** you will be given a **list of participants separated** by ", ".

On the **next few lines until you receive** a line "end of race" you will be given some info which will be some **alphanumeric characters**.

In between them you could have **some extra characters which you should ignore**.

For **example**: "G!32e%o7r#32g$235@!2e".

The **letters are the name of the person** and the **sum of the digits is the distance he ran**.

So here we have **George who ran 29 km**.

**Store the information** about the **person only if the list of racers contains the name** of the person.

If you receive the **same person more than once** just **add the distance to his old distance**.

At the end **print the top 3 racers ordered by distance in descending** in the format:

"1st place: \{first racer\}

2nd place: \{second racer\}

3rd place: \{third racer\}"

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| George, Peter, Bill, Tom | 1st place: George |
| G4e@55or%6g6!68e!!@ | 2nd place: Peter |
| R1@!3a$y4456@ | 3rd place: Tom |
| B5@i@#123ll | |
| G@e54o$r6ge# | |
| 7P%et^#e5346r | |
| T$o553m&6 | |
| end of race | |

### Comments
- On the third input line we have Ray. 
- He is not in the list, so we do not count his result. 
- The other ones are valid. 
- George has total of 55 km, Peter has 25 and Tom has 19. 
- We do not print Bill because he is on the fourth place.

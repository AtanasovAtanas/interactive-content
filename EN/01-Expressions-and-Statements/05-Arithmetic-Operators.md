# Arithmetic Operations
Let's examine the basic **arithmetic operations** in programming. 

We can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers using the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.

## Summing up Numbers
We can **sum** up numbers using the `+` operator:
```js live
let a = 5;
let b = 7;
let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum); // 12 
```

## Subtracting Numbers
**Subtracting** numbers is done using the `-` operator:
```js live
let a = 15;
let b = 7;
console.log(a - b); // 8
```

## Multiplying Numbers
For **multiplication** of numbers we use the `*` operator:
```js live
let a = 5;
let b = 7;
console.log(a * b); // 35
```

## Dividing Numbers
**Dividing** numbers is done using the `/` operator.

The number type represents **both** integer and floating point numbers. There is **no integer division by default**.
* If you do this: 
```js live
let result = 5/4; //1.25
console.log(result);
```
the expected result is 1, but the answer is 1.25.

Integer division can easily be achieved by flooring the quotient of the two numbers, using `Math.floor()`:
```js live
let result = Math.floor(5/4); //1
console.log(result);
```
This leads to a problem though. What if you had a situation like this:
```js live
let result = Math.floor(-5/4); //-2
console.log(result);
```
In this case the quotient is negative. 
* The expected answer is -1, but youâ€™ll get -2 instead. 
* Flooring works the opposite way for negative numbers. An if statement can fix this:
```js live
let result = -5/4;
if(result >=0)
    result = Math.floor(result);
else
    result = Math.ceil(result);
console.log(result);
```
When it comes to dividing numbers by zero, there are two main cases:
```js live
let result = 0/0; //NaN
console.log(result);
```
```js live
let result = 1/0; //Infinity
console.log(result);
```

Here are a few examples with the division operator:
```js live
let a = -5;
let i = a / 0;
console.log(i);
let f = a / 4.0;
console.log(f);
```

### Remainder
The remainder operator `%` computes the remainder after dividing its left-hand operand by its right-hand operand.
```js live
let a = 7;
let b = 2;
console.log(a % b);
console.log(3.5 % 1);
```
It is useful if we want to check whether a number is **even** or **odd**.

If the remainder when dividing by 2 is equal to 0, then the number is even, otherwise it is odd.

See the following example: 
```js live
console.log(3 % 2);
console.log(4 % 2);
```

 # Character Classes

  In the **context of regular expressions**, a character class is a **set of characters enclosed within square brackets**. 

  It specifies the **characters** that will **successfully match** a **single character** from a given **input string**.

- Simple Class - a set of characters side-by-side within square brackets:
  - `[abc]` - [image assetsSrc="regex-example(2).png" /] - matches any character that is either a, b or c

- Negation - the "^" metacharacter at the beginning of the character class matches all characters except the listed
  - `[^abc]` - matches any character that is not a, b or c: a**lph**ab**eti**c

- Ranges - 
  - `[0-9]` - character **range** matches any digit from 0 to 9:
  [image assetsSrc="regex-example.png" /]

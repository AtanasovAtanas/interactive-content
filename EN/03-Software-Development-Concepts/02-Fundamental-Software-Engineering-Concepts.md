# Math Concepts in Software Development

**Simple mathematical concepts** are often needed and applied in software development.

This doesn't mean that software developers should be strong mathematicians, but they should be familiar with the **basic math concepts at school level**.

Developers don't need to prove theorems or solve differential equations, but they need to understand **coordinate systems**, they need to know what a function is, they need to be able to perform **simple calculations**, and they need to have well-developed **algorithmic thinking**, which is like the logical thinking used in math.

**School-level math is enough for most developers**, unless they are involved with computer graphics, machine learning or other math-intensive specialization.

Below are the most important **mathematical concepts** related to programming:

**Coordinate systems** and **graphical objects** with their size, position and other numerical characteristics are used in computer graphics and user interface systems, such as `HTML` and `CSS`, `PDF`, `SVG` and others.

**Mathematical functions**, elements of lambda calculus, discrete functions and other simple mathematical transformations are used by developers when they write code, as part of the functional programming paradigm and some modern architectural approaches like "**serverless computations**".


**Vectors** and **matrices** may be used in graphics, machine learning, and everywhere else.
In fact, developers are using vectors every day, because "**vector**" is the mathematical name of "**arrays and lists**".
"**Matrices**" is the mathematical name of "**tables**" that we know well from spreadsheet and Excel applications.

Finite state **automata** and **state machines** are used in parsers (which extract data from structured text), in process management and workflow management software and in interpreters and compilers.

**Statistics** concepts, such as probability distributions, statistical significance, hypothesis testing, and regression are widely used in data science and machine learning.

In machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence systems, math skills are more important.

But in traditional (mainstream) Web, mobile and back-end development, we need nothing more than **school-level math** and **logical thinking**.

**Algorithm complexity** is a math concept from the mathematical analysis, used to estimate the execution speed of the code, based on the approximation of the steps needed to be executed.

Developers need to learn the concept of "**time complexity**" and what is linear time, quadratic time, cubic time and logarithmic time, which is quite simple, and mathematics is not deeply involved.

**Mathematical modeling** is the art of translating problems from an application area into tractable **mathematical** or **formal** formulations whose theoretical, numerical and algorithmic analysis provides insight, answers, and guidance useful for the originating application.

**Mathematical modeling** is important skill, related to algorithmic thinking and developers with strong problem-solving skills learn how to use it at basic level.


This is an **example** of how basic **school-level mathematical skills** are used to **draw objects** using SVG (scalable vector graphics) – the vector graphics standard for the Web.

```
<svg width="500" height="250" style="background:lightgray">
  <rect x="100" y="50" width="200" height="100" rx="5" ry="5" 
  style="fill:red; stroke:black; stroke-width:5; opacity:0.7" />
</svg>
```

We draw a rectangle at certain **position** at the coordinate system, with certain **size**, border **width** and border **radius**.

Developers use similar concepts when they **create the user interface of their apps**, using `HTML` and `CSS` or `XAML` or other graphical representation technology.

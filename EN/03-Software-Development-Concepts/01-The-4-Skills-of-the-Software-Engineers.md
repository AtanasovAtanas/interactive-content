# Skills of the Software Engineers

There are **4 main groups** of skills, that **any skillful programmer** has and to which every beginner must strive:

- **Coding skills**, which form 20% of the developer skills, are **the skills to write and debug code and use developer tools**.
    - These skills include working with data and calculations, using loops and basic data structures like arrays and lists, using objects and programming APIs.


- The **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving skills**, which form 30% of the developer skills, are the skills to solve technical problems by:
    - analyzing the problem and **generating ideas** how to solve it,
    - designing a sequence of steps (called **algorithm**) to obtain the expected results from the input data
    - and **implement** the steps to build the solution.


- The fundamental **software engineering concepts** form about 25% of developer skills.
    - These skills include many **programming paradigms**, essential software development knowledge and skills, software engineering **principles** and **concepts** that developers typically acquire as they gain experience over time.

    - These skills include **object-oriented** and **functional programming**, **data structures** and **algorithms**, **networking** and **Web**, **front-end** and **back-end** concepts, **databases**, **source control systems** and **team working**.


- **Programming languages and software technologies** (which form only 25% of the developer skills) are what we see at the job offers for developers.
    - Front-end technologies like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Angular` and `React`
    - Back-end technologies like `C#` and `ASP.NET MVC`, `Java` and `Spring` framework, `Python` and `Django`, `JavaScript` and `Node.js`
    - Database technologies like `SQL Server`, `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` and **ORM frameworks** like **Entity Framework** and **Spring Data**

# Skill #1: Coding - 20%

**Coding skills** form 20% of the developer skills.
These are the **skills to write and debug code** and they include the following components:

- Coding (writing commands, scripts and programs), using development environments (the so-called IDEs) and developer tools
- Working with variables and data, calculations, using conditional statements and loops

- Writing and using functions, methods, classes and objects

- Working with data structures, such as arrays, lists, maps, strings, and trees
- Using programming APIs, libraries and software packages
- Troubleshooting and debugging the code and using a debugger

The **skill of coding** can be acquired after **several months** of hard learning and solving practical problems and writing code every day.
- At SoftUni the coding skills are mastered in the first few training courses of our end-to-end software engineering program:
    - in the "**Programing Basics**" training course,
    - in the "**Programming Fundamentals**" course,
    - and in the next few courses, where these skills are further developed.

Remember that **the programming language does not matter** for the ability to code.
- **Coding is essential skill**, which once learned, can be applied in many programming languages.
- To master the **skill of coding**, you need to invest **2 or 3 months** of intensive training and coding every day or learn slowly for а longer period.

# Skill #2: Algorithmic Thinking - 30%

The second essential skill of software developers is **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving** (which forms 30% of the developer skills).

- **Algorithmic thinking** is a way of getting to a solution through the clear definition of the steps needed.
- It includes the ability to analyze the problem and break it into a **logical sequence of steps** (called "**algorithm**"), to find a solution for every separate step (or break it further into sub-steps) and then assemble these steps into a working solution.

- The **algorithmic thinking** is similar concept to **logical thinking**, **engineering thinking**, **mathematical thinking** and **abstract thinking**.
    - All these concepts are related to the ability to **solve problems**: to think logically, to analyze the problems, and to find and implement **solutions**.
    - That's why good mathematicians, physicists, architectural or mechanical engineers can easily learn programming and software development: they have strong engineering thinking and problem-solving skills.
    - Others may also learn algorithmic thinking and software development, but they will need more time.

- "**Problem solving**" is more general skill, while "**algorithmic thinking**" is more technical (or engineering) skill.

- **Problem solving** is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; analyzing the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution successfully.

- In computer science we deal with "**technical problem solving**", which is the most important skill of any programmer: the ability to solve technical problems by breaking them into sequences of steps and implementing these steps with code.

To master the skill of **solving technical problems and develop algorithmic thinking**, it is necessary to invest **6-12 months** of intensive training and practicing every day and to solve at least **1000 practical programming problems**.

At **SoftUni** algorithmic thinking and problem solving are mastered during the "**Programming Basics**" and the "**Programming Fundamentals**" courses and in the **Advanced programming** modules (in the professional tracks) and are later extended in the optional "**Data Structures and Algorithms**" module.

The **programming language and software technologies doesn't matter** for the algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

- Developers with **strong algorithmic thinking** will be able to design and implement algorithms in any programming language.

- These are essential skills that **once learned will help you throughout your life**. They do not age over time.

# Skill #3: Fundamental Concepts - 25%

The fundamental **computer science and software engineering concepts and principles** form about 25% of developer skills.

These are **the skills that we will mention in this lesson** and that developers are learning for many years during their software engineering education and professional career.

These **fundamental computer science and software development concepts** include many programming **paradigms**, essential software development knowledge and skills, software engineering **principles** and **concepts**.

Some of these knowledge areas and concepts are the following:

- **Object-oriented programming** - **OOP**, working with classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism.

- **Functional programming - FP**, working with pure functions, declarative programming and immutable data.

- **Asynchronous programming** and concurrent execution, working with threads, background tasks, promises and others.

- **Databases**: 
    - relational databases, the entity-relationship model, the SQL language 
    - NoSQL databases, document-oriented databases, the key-value model, database engines 
    - programming APIs and tools for database programming and ORM frameworks

- **Web technologies**: 
    - HTTP protocol
    - Front-end Web development (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `DOM`, `AJAX`, `REST`)
    - Back-end Web development, MVC frameworks, routing engines, templating engines, cloud technologies etc.

- Software engineering: 
    - Development methodologies, agile principles, teamwork principles.
    - Source control systems, project management principles, quality assurance.

The basics of all these software development principles and engineering concepts are learned in the professional modules from the SoftUni curriculum (see [softuni.org/curriculum](softuni.org/curriculum)).

It takes **1-2 years** of specialized training and practical software development to learn the basics of these fundamental software development concepts.

Developers learn these concepts in greater detail for **many years**, as they gain more and more experience during their professional career path.

These principles of software engineering and development paradigms are independent of programming languages and specific technologies.

- **The programming language does not matter** for the assimilation of all these skills.
- These concepts are **highly stable over the time**: once learned, they don't change significantly for decades.

# Skill #4: Languages & Technologies - 25%

**Programming languages and software technologies** (which form only 25% of the developer skills) are what we see at the **job offers for developers**.

- **Programming languages** - `JavaScript`, `C#` and `Python`
- **Software development technologies** - `React`, `ASP.NET Core` and `Django`
- **Software platforms** - `Java EE` and `.NET Core`
- **Software libraries** - `Apache Commons` and `ML.NET`
- **Development frameworks** - `Spring MVC` and `Angular`
- **Developer tools** - `npm`, `Visual Studio`, `Webpack` and `Maven` 

We can see all these requirements in most job offers for software developers, but they are **the last 25%** of the developers' skills.

The **other 75%** of the developer skills are **coding**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **development concepts**, which are considered to be mastered by the job offers.

That's why many job offers for junior devs require **1-2 years of experience**: because this experience guarantees good coding skills, at least basic algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills and at least basic level of understanding the main development concepts and principles, together with certain stack of software technologies.

The programming languages and technologies always come, as a **technology stack** (or software development stack).
**Development stacks** are sets of **related programming languages, software technologies and tools**, which are used together.
The term "stack" is used because some technologies depend directly on others and work on top of each other like a stack.
"**Development stack**" simply means the set of languages, platforms, frameworks, libraries, IDEs and tools used for application development, including the operating system, the software or cloud platform, database server and application server.

For Example:
- **LAMP** stack (`Linux` + `Apache` + `MySQL` + `PHP`) 
- **Django** stack (`Python` + `Django` + `PostgreSQL`).

Here are some more detailed examples of commonly used software development stacks which software companies are looking for:
`.NET` development stack:
    -  `C#` + `.NET Core` + `Visual Studio` 
    - **databases** + `SQL Server` + `SQL` + `Entity Framework`
    - ` ASP.NET MVC` and `Web API` + `HTML` + `CSS` + `JavaScript` + `AJAX` + `RESTful` services + `JSON` +
    -  **object-oriented programming** + **functional programming** + **algorithmic thinking** 
    - **source control systems** and `Git` + **software engineering** + **cloud** + **containers** + **English** and **teamwork skills**.

`JavaScript` development stack: 
    - `JavaScript` + **functional programming** + **object-oriented programming**
    - **databases** + `MongoDB` or `MySQL` + `HTTP` + **web programming** 
    - **web front-end** (`HTML` with `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `DOM` and `jQuery` or `Angular` or `React`)
    - **web back-end** (`Node.js` and `Express`) + **JavaScript tools** + **cloud** + **containers**.

`Python` development stack: 
    - `Python`+ **object-oriented programming** + **functional programming** 
    - **databases** + `MongoDB` or `MySQL` or `PostgreSQL` + `HTTP` 
    - web development + `HTML` + `CSS` + `JavaScript` and `DOM` + `jQuery`
    - some **MVC framework** like `Django` or `Flask` + cloud and containers.

`Java` development stacks: 
    - `Java`+ **Java API classes** + **object-oriented programming** + **functional programming**
    - **databases** + `MySQL` + `HTTP` + web programming + 
    - **web front-end** - `HTML` + `CSS` + `JS` + `DOM` + `jQuery` + `JSP` and `Servlets` 
    - `Spring MVC` or `Java EE` + cloud and containers.

All these technologies consist of large amount of **technical knowledge**, which **change very fast**.
Once you learn a software technology, such as Angular 9 or Java EE 8, it will be **outdated in few years** or even months and new versions or entirely new technologies will come as replacement. 

This is normal! Live with the understanding that **technology is changing fast**. 

What stays for long are the **coding skills**, **algorithmic thinking** and **software development concepts** and **principles**.
The usual **lifetime** of modern software technologies is **2-3 years**.

At **SoftUni** we teach modern software technologies in the professional modules of our **end-to-end training program for software engineers**.

We combine learning of **modern software technologies** together with **fundamental development concepts** and **principles** and **problem-solving skills**.

In the professional modules at **SoftUni** we focus on certain development stack (based on `C#`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Python` or other language) and we gain experience with it through a lot of exercises and practical projects.

Remember that **software technologies are only 25%** of the developer skills and are highly dependent on the previous 75%, the general software development skills, which are:

- Strong coding skills
- Algorithmic thinking and technical problem solving
- Computer science and software development concepts

# The 4 Skills of Software Engineers

# Skills of the Software Engineers

There are **4 main groups** of skills, that **any skillful programmer** has and to which every beginner must strive:

- **Coding skills**, which form 20% of the developer skills, are **the skills to write and debug code and use developer tools**.
    - These skills include working with data and calculations, using loops and basic data structures like arrays and lists, using objects and programming APIs.

- The **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving skills**, which form 30% of the developer skills, are the skills to solve technical problems by:
    - analyzing the problem and **generating ideas** how to solve it,
    - designing a sequence of steps (called **algorithm**) to obtain the expected results from the input data
    - and **implement** the steps to build the solution.

- The fundamental **software engineering concepts** form about 25% of developer skills.
    - These skills include many **programming paradigms**, essential software development knowledge and skills, software engineering **principles** and **concepts** that developers typically acquire as they gain experience over time.
    - These skills include **object-oriented** and **functional programming**, **data structures** and **algorithms**, **networking** and **Web**, **front-end** and **back-end** concepts, **databases**, **source control systems** and **team working**.

- **Programming languages and software technologies** (which form only 25% of the developer skills) are what we see at the job offers for developers.
    - Front-end technologies like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Angular` and `React`
    - Back-end technologies like `C#` and `ASP.NET MVC`, `Java` and `Spring` framework, `Python` and `Django`, `JavaScript` and `Node.js`
    - Database technologies like `SQL Server`, `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` and **ORM frameworks** like **Entity Framework** and **Spring Data**

# Skill #1: Coding - 20%

**Coding skills** form 20% of the developer skills.
These are the **skills to write and debug code** and they include the following components:

- Coding (writing commands, scripts and programs), using development environments (the so-called IDEs) and developer tools
- Working with variables and data, calculations, using conditional statements and loops

- Writing and using functions, methods, classes and objects

- Working with data structures, such as arrays, lists, maps, strings, and trees
- Using programming APIs, libraries and software packages
- Troubleshooting and debugging the code and using a debugger

The **skill of coding** can be acquired after **several months** of hard learning and solving practical problems and writing code every day.
- At SoftUni the coding skills are mastered in the first few training courses of our end-to-end software engineering program:
    - in the "**Programing Basics**" training course,
    - in the "**Programming Fundamentals**" course,
    - and in the next few courses, where these skills are further developed.

Remember that **the programming language does not matter** for the ability to code.
- **Coding is essential skill**, which once learned, can be applied in many programming languages.
- To master the **skill of coding**, you need to invest **2 or 3 months** of intensive training and coding every day or learn slowly for а longer period.

# Skill #2: Algorithmic Thinking - 30%

The second essential skill of software developers is **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving** (which forms 30% of the developer skills).

- **Algorithmic thinking** is a way of getting to a solution through the clear definition of the steps needed.
- It includes the ability to analyze the problem and break it into a **logical sequence of steps** (called "**algorithm**"), to find a solution for every separate step (or break it further into sub-steps) and then assemble these steps into a working solution.

- The **algorithmic thinking** is similar concept to **logical thinking**, **engineering thinking**, **mathematical thinking** and **abstract thinking**.
    - All these concepts are related to the ability to **solve problems**: to think logically, to analyze the problems, and to find and implement **solutions**.
    - That's why good mathematicians, physicists, architectural or mechanical engineers can easily learn programming and software development: they have strong engineering thinking and problem-solving skills.
    - Others may also learn algorithmic thinking and software development, but they will need more time.

- "**Problem solving**" is more general skill, while "**algorithmic thinking**" is more technical (or engineering) skill.

- **Problem solving** is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; analyzing the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution successfully.

- In computer science we deal with "**technical problem solving**", which is the most important skill of any programmer: the ability to solve technical problems by breaking them into sequences of steps and implementing these steps with code.

To master the skill of **solving technical problems and develop algorithmic thinking**, it is necessary to invest **6-12 months** of intensive training and practicing every day and to solve at least **1000 practical programming problems**.

At **SoftUni** algorithmic thinking and problem solving are mastered during the "**Programming Basics**" and the "**Programming Fundamentals**" courses and in the **Advanced programming** modules (in the professional tracks) and are later extended in the optional "**Data Structures and Algorithms**" module.

The **programming language and software technologies doesn't matter** for the algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

- Developers with **strong algorithmic thinking** will be able to design and implement algorithms in any programming language.

- These are essential skills that **once learned will help you throughout your life**. They do not age over time.

## Description
Create an article class with the following properties:
- Title – a string
- Content – a string
- Author – a string

The class should have a constructor and the following methods:
- **Edit** (new content) – change the old content with the new one
- **ChangeAuthor** (new author) – change the author
- **Rename** (new title) – change the title of the article
- **override ToString** – print the article in the following format: 

"\{title\} - \{content\}:\{author\}"

Write a program that reads an article in the following **format** "\{title\}, \{content\}, \{author\}". 

On the next line, you will get a **number n**. 

On the **next n lines**, you will get one of the following **commands**: 
- "Edit: \{new content\}" 
- "ChangeAuthor: \{new author\}" 
- "Rename: \{new title\}". 

At the end, **print the final article**.


### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| some title, some content, some author | better title - better content: better author |
| 3 | |
| Edit: better content | |
| ChangeAuthor:  better author | |

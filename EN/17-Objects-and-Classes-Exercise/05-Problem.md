## Description
Until you receive the **command** "End" you will receive lines of input in the format:
- \{typeOfVehicle\} \{model\} \{color\} \{horsepower\}

After the "End" command, you will start receiving **models of vehicles**. **Print for every received vehicle** its data in the **format**:

Type: \{typeOfVehicle\}

Model: \{modelOfVehicle\}

Color: \{colorOfVehicle\}

Horsepower: \{horsepowerOfVehicle\}

When you receive the command "Close the Catalogue", stop receiving **input and print the average horsepower** for the cars and for the trucks in the **format**:

"\{typeOfVehicles\} have average horsepower of \{averageHorsepower\}."

The average horsepower is **calculated** by **dividing the sum of horsepower for all vehicles of the type by the total count of vehicles from the same type**.

Format the answer to the **second decimal point**.

## Description
**Explosions are marked** with '>'.

Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer, which signifies the **strength of the explosion**.

You should **remove x characters** (where x is the strength of the explosion), **starting after the punch character** ('>').

If you find **another explosion mark** ('>') **while you're deleting characters**, you should **add the strength to your previous explosion**.

When all characters are processed, **print the string without the deleted characters**. 

You **should not delete the explosion character** - '>', but you **should delete the integers**, which represent the strength.

### Input
You will receive single line with the string.

### Output
Print what is left from the string after explosions.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| abv>1>1>2>2asdasd | abv>>>>dasd |

### Comments
1st explosion is at index 3 and it is with strength of 1. 

We delete only the digit after the explosion character. 

The string will look like this: abv>>1>2>2asdasd

2nd explosion is with strength one and the string transforms to this: abv>>>2>2asdasd

3rd explosion is now with strength of 2. 

We delete the digit and we find another explosion. 

At this point the string looks like this: abv>>>>2asdasd. 

4th explosion is with strength 2. 

We have 1 strength left from the previous explosion, we add the strength of the current explosion to what is left and that adds up to a total strength of 3. 

We delete the next three characters and we receive the string abv>>>>dasd 

We do not have any more explosions and we print the result: abv>>>>dasd

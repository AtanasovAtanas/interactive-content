Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to **automatically resize**, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on **all devices** (desktops, tablets, and phones).

## What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the area of a web page witch is visible for the user.

The viewport varies and is smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

### Setting The Viewport

Through the <meta> tag in HTML you can take control over the viewport.

For using it, you should include the following `<meta>` **viewport** element in all your web pages:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This will give the browser instructions on how to control the page’s **dimensions** and **scaling**.

`width=device-width` - sets the width of the page to follow the **screen-width** of the **device**.

`initial-scale=1.0` - sets the **initial zoom** level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

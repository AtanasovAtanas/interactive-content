# Structured Query Language - SQL

[image assetsSrc="mssql1.png" /]

The SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed for **managing data** in a relational database.

To communicate with the database engine, we use **SQL**.

With it, we write queries that are then **executed by the engine**.

It is logically divided into **four sections**.

Data definition describes the structure of the data.

Data manipulation, such as **storing**, **updating**, **deleting**, and **retrieving data**.

Data control, defining roles, giving permissions, defining who can access the data.

Bundle operations that have to be executed together.

If all of them are executed successfully, the **changes are applied**.

Otherwise, a rollback happens and all changes are reverted.

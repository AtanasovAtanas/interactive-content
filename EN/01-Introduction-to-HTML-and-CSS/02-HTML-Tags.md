# HTML Tags

In HTML, a tag is used for **creating an element**. 

Each HTML tag describes that the browser should do something instead of simply displaying the text. In HTML, the tags begin with (`<`) and end with (`>`).

HTML tags can be of two types:
- Paired Tags
- Unpaired Tags

## Paired Tags
A tag is said to be a paired tag if the text is placed between a tag and its companion tag. In paired tags, the first tag is referred to as **opening tag** and the second tag is referred to as **closing tag**.

Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a **slash character** `</b>`.

Example:
```html
<b>This is bold text.</b>
```

**Note:** Here `<b>` is called opening tag and `</b>` is called closing tag.

## Unpaired Tags

An unpaired tag does not have a closing tag. Unpaired tags are also known as singular or stand-alone tags.

Example
```html
<br>
```

This tag does not require a closing tag.

## Tags Based on Their Usage

We can differentiate tags based on the **purpose they used**. Basically we have three types:
- **Formatting tags** - manage the size of the font, underline part of the text, make the text bold etc.
- **Semantic tags** - description, title, head, body, etc.
- **Control tags** - form tags, script tags, radio buttons, etc are used for interaction with user.

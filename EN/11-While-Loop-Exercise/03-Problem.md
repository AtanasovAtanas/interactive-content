# Description

Write a program that calculates the **average grade** of a student from his entire education. 

# Input
- On the first line you will receive **the name of the student**, and on each following line his annual grades. - The student passes to upper class, if his **annual grade is 4.00 or greater**. 
- If his grade is less than 4.00, he has to **repeat** the class.

# Output
- If the student graduates **12th** class, you have to print:
    - "\{student name\} graduated. Average grade: \{average grade from his entire education\}"

**The grade should be formatted to the second decimal point.**

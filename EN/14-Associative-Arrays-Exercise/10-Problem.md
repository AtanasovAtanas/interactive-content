## Description
Judge statistics on the last Programing Fundamentals exam was not working correctly, so you have the task to take all the submissions and analyze them properly.

You should collect all the submissions and print the final results and statistics about each language that the participants submitted their solutions in.

You will be receiving lines in the following format: "\{username\}-\{language\}-\{points\}" until you receive "exam finished".

You should store each username and their submissions and points. 

You can receive a command to ban a user for cheating in the following format: "\{username\}-banned".

In that case, you should remove the user from the contest, but preserve their submissions in the total count of submissions for each language.

After receiving "exam finished" print each of the participants, ordered descending by their max points, then by username, in the following format:

"Results:

\{username\} \| \{points\}"

After that print each language, used in the exam, ordered descending by total submission count and then by language name, in the following format:

"Submissions:

\{language\} – \{submissionsCount\}"

### Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Peter-Java-91 | Results: |
| George-C#-84 | Peter \| 91 |
| Mike-Java-90 | George \| 84 |
| Mike-C#-50 | Submissions: |
| Mike-banned | C# - 2 |
| exam finished | Java - 2 |

### Comments
Mike is banned so he is removed from the contest, but his submissions are still preserved in the submissions count. 

So although there are only 2 participants in the results, there are 4 submissions in total.

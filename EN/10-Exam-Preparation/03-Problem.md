## Description
Create a program that **manages users and emails** sent by users.

You need to keep information about their username and their sent emails.

The emails are **represented as strings**.

You will be **receiving lines with commands separated by** "->" **until you receive** the "Statistics" command.

There are **three possible commands**:
- "Add->\{username\}" 
    - **Check if the username exists and if it does print** - "\{username\} is already registered"
    - If it doesn't exist, then add the user to the collection of users.
- "Send->\{username\}->\{Email\}" 
    - Add the \{Email\} to the \{username\}'s collection of sent emails.
- "Delete->\{username\}"
    - Delete the given user, if he exists. 
    - If the user doesnâ€™t exist, print "\{username\} not found!"

In the end, you have to **print the count of users**, **each user with his/her emails**. 

**Users** need to be **sorted in descending order** by the **count of sent Ğµmails and then by their username in ascending order in the following format**:  

Users count: \{count\}

\{username\} 

 - \{Email1\}

 - \{Email2\}

 - \{EmailN\}

### Input
- You will be receiving lines until you receive the "Statistics" command.
- The commands will be in the format described above.

### Output
- Print the collection in the format described above after the "Statistics" command.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Add->Mike | Users count: 2 |
| Add->George | George |
| Send->George->Hello World |  - Hello World |
| Send->George->Some random test mail |  - Some random test mail |
| Send->Mike->Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |  - It would be a pleasure |
| Send->George->It would be a pleasure | Mike |
| Send->Mike->Another random test mail |  - Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |
| Statistics |  - Another random test mail |

### Comment
- First we receive our users.
- Since they are not already in our collection, we add them. 
- Then they start sending emails and in the end we print the output in the described format.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Add->Mike | Mike is already registered |
| Add->George | Peter not found! |
| Send->George->Hello World | Users count: 1 |
| Send->George->Your loan is overdue | Mike |
| Add->Mike |  - Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |
| Send->Mike->Hello, do you want to meet up tomorrow? |  - Another random test mail |
| Delete->Peter | |
| Send->George->I'm busy | |
| Send->Mike->Another random test mail | |
| Delete->George | |
| Statistics | |

## Description
You are tasked to help planning a course by keeping track of the **lessons**, that are going to be included in the course, as well as all the **exercises** for the lessons.

On the **first input line** you will receive the **initial schedule of lessons and exercises** that are going to be part of the next course, **separated by comma and space** ", ". 

But before the course starts, there are some changes to be made. 

Until you receive "course start" you will be given some commands to modify the course schedule. 

The **possible commands** are: 

- Add:\{lessonTitle\} - **add the lesson to the end of the schedule**, if it does **not exist**
- Insert:\{lessonTitle\}:\{index\} - **insert the lesson to the given index**, if it does **not exist**
- Remove:\{lessonTitle\} - **remove the lesson**, if it **exists**
- Swap:\{lessonTitle\}:\{lessonTitle\} - **change the place of the two lessons**, if they **exist**
- Exercise:\{lessonTitle\} - **add exercise in the schedule right after the lesson index**
    - **if the lesson exists** and there is **no exercise already,** in the following format "\{lessonTitle\}-Exercise"
    - **if the lesson doesn't exist**, **add the lesson** in the end of the course schedule, **followed by the exercise**

Each time you **swap or remove a lesson**, you should **do the same with the exercises**, if there are any, which follow the lessons.

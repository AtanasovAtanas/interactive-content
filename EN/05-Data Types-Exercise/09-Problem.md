## Description
Write a program that **calculates the total amount of spice** that can be extracted from a source. 

The source has a **starting** yield, which indicates how much spice can be mined on the **first day**.

After it has been mined for a day, the yield drops by 10, meaning on the **second day it’ll produce 10 less spice** than on the first, on the **third day 10 less than on the second**, and **so on** (see examples). 

A source is considered **profitable only while its yield is at least 100** – when less than 100 spice is expected in a day, abandon the source.

The mining **crew consumes 26 spice every day** at the **end of their shift and an additional 26** after the mine has been exhausted. Note that the workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage. 

When the operation is complete, **print on the console on two separate lines** how many **days** the mine has operated and the total **amount** of spice extracted.


### Input
You will **receive a number**, representing the **starting** yield of the source. 

### Output
Print **two separate lines** how many **days the mine has operated** and the **total amount of spice extracted**.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 111 | 2 |
| | 134 |

**Comments** 
- Day 1 we extract 111 spice and at the end of the shift, the workers consume 26, leaving 85. The yield drops by 10 to 101.
- Day 2 we extract 101 spice, the workers consume 26, leaving 75. The total is 160 and the yield has dropped to 91.
- Since the expected yield is less than 100, we abandon the source. The workers take another 26, leaving 134. The mine has operated 2 days.

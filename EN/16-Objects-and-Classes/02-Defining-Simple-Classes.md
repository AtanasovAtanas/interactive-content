# Defining Simple Classes

When defining class, it contains only those components of a class declaration that are required.

The obligatory components are:
- Keyword - `class`
- Class name
- Class body - between `{}`

Non obligatory, but credential, components are: 
- Class fields
- Constructor
- Getters and Setters
- Class methods

Each class, field, constructor, method is initialized with an access modifier in front, which specifies the accessibility. Ð¢he access level can be changed by applying the access modifier on it. We will cover this in the next course. 

There is a possibility to generate automatically via IntelliJ IDEA constructors, getters, setters, and other most used methods. It is possible by Right-click + Generate. The short command depends on the operation system of the computer: in Windows and Linux - Alt + Insert; in Macintosh - Cmd + N.

# Naming Classes

The class name is with the initial letter capitalized by convention, i.e. **PascalCase naming**. 

The class name should contain descriptive nouns.

Abbreviations is required to be avoided (except widely known, e.g. URL, HTTP, etc.).

```java
class MyClass {

}
```

# Fields

Fields store **values** 
`private String type;` `private int age;` `private boolean vegetarian;`

Fields represent the **state** of an object.

There can be specified as many fields as needed.


```java
class Animal {
    // fields
    private String type;
    private int age;
    private boolean vegetarian;
    
}
```

# Constructor

Special method, executed during object creation, that **sets object's initial state**.

Constructor name is the **same as the name of the class**.

Constructor **can take parameters**, which is used to **initialize fields**.

All classes have **constructor by default**. 

There can be **multiple constructors of the same class**. This helps to instantiate objects in various ways with a different number of arguments.

```java
class Animal {
    // fields
    private String type;
    private int age;
    private boolean vegetarian;
    
    // constructors
    public Animal() {
        
    }
    public Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}
```

# Getters and Setters

Getter provide **access** to field and read its value. 

Naming convention: `getXxx()`, where **Xxx** is the name of the variable. 

Since the getter method is **return** type, the data type of the value returned by the method is the same as the field type.

Setter provide field's **change** and update its value. 

Naming convention: `setXxx()`, where **Xxx** is the name of the variable. 

The setter method is **void** type.

```java
class Animal {
    // field
    private String type;
    . . .
    // getter
    public int getType() {
        return this.type;
    }

    // setter
    public void setType(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}
```

# Methods

Methods describe **behavior** of an object 
`public void animalSound() { ... }`
Methods store **executable code** (algorithm) that manipulate state.

```java
class Animal {
    // fields
    private String type;
    private int age;
    private boolean vegetarian;

    // method
    public void animalSound() {
        System.put.println("The animal makes a sound")
    }

}
```

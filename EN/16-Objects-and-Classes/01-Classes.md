# Classes

Classes and objects are the **two main aspects** of object-orientated programming. 

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its fields and methods.

In programming classes provide the **structure for describing and creating objects**. 

A class is like a "blueprint" for creating objects.

It builds specification of a given type objects from the real-world.

## Declaring Class

The class **body** (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from class:
   - **Fields** that provide the state of the class and its objects;
   Example: day; month; year;
   - **Constructors** for initializing new objects;
   - **Getters and Setters** for accessing and changing the fields;
   Example: getDay; setMonth; getYear; setYear;
   - **Methods** to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.
   Example: plusDay(count); subtract(date);

```java
class MyClass {
    // field
    // constructor
    // getters and setters
    // other methods
}
```

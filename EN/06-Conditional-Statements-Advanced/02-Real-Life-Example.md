|Product|Weekday|Weekend| 
|-------|-------|-------|
|Banana|2.50|2.70|
|Apple|1.30|1.60|

If product is banana
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.50
  Otherwise the price is 2.70
If product is apple
  If its a weekday the price is 1.30
  Otherwise the price is 1.60
If product is kiwi
  If its a weekday the price is 2.20
  Otherwise the price is 3.00

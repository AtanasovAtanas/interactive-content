## Description
You are given a sequence of people and for every person what **cards** he draws from the deck.

The input will be **separate** lines in the **format**:

`{personName}: {PT, PT, PT,â€¦ PT}`

Where P (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) is the power of the card and T (S, H, D, C) is the type. The input ends when a **"JOKER"** is drawn. 

The name can contain any ASCII symbol except **":"**. 

The input will always be valid and in the format described, there is no need to check it.

A single person **cannot have more than one** card with the same power and type, if he draws such a card he **discards** it. 

The people are playing with **multiple decks**. 

Each card has a value that is **calculated** by the power multiplied by the type. 

Powers **2 to 10** have the same value and **J to A** are **11 to 14**. 

Types are mapped to multipliers the following way (**S -> 4, H-> 3, D -> 2, C -> 1**).

Finally print out the **total value each player** has in his hand in the format:

`{personName}: {value}`

## Description
You are a young and ambitious owner of a Pet Clinics Holding.

You ask your employees to create a program which will store all information about the pets in the database.

Each pet should have **name**, **age** and **kind**.


Your application should support a few basic operations such as **creating** a pet, **creating** a clinic, **adding** a pet to a clinic, **releasing** a pet from a clinic, **printing** information about a **specific** room in a clinic or printing information about **all** rooms in a clinic.

Clinics should have an **odd** number of rooms, attempting to create a clinic with an **even** number of should **fail** and **throw** an appropriate **exception**.

## Accommodation Order

For example, let us take a look at a clinic with 5 rooms. 

The **first** room where a pet will be treated is the **central** one (room 3). 

So the order of which an animal is entering is: the first animal is going to the **center** (3) room and after that the next pets are entering first to the **left** (2) and then to the **right** (4) room. 

The last rooms in which pets can enter are room 1 and room 5. 

In case a room is already occupied, we skip it and go to the next room in the above order. Your task is to model the application and make it support some commands.

The first pet enters room 3. -> 1 2 **3** 4 5

After that, the next pet enters room 2. -> 1 **2** 3 4 5

The third pet would enter room 4. -> 1 2 3 **4** 5

And the last two pets would be going to rooms - 1 and 5. -> **1** 2 3 4 **5**

Now when we have covered adding the pets, it is time to find a way to release them. 

The process of releasing them is not so simple when the release method is called, we start from the **center** room (3) and continue **right** (4, 5â€¦ and so on) until we find a pet or reach the **last** room. 

If we reach the last room, we start from the **first** (1) and again move right until we reach the ** center** room (3). 

If a pet is found, we **remove** it from the collection, stop the further search, and **return** `true`, if a pet is **NOT** found, the operation **returns** `false`.

When a print command for a room is called, if the room contains a pet we print the pet on a single line in the format `{pet name} {pet age} {pet kind}`. 

Alternatively, if the room is empty print **"Room empty"** instead. 

When a `Print` command for a clinic is called it should print **all** rooms in the clinic in **order** of their number.

### Commands

| **Command** | **Return Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Create Pet {name} {age} {kind}` | void | Creates a pet with the specified name and age.(true if the operation is successful and false if it isn't) |
| Create Clinic \{name} \{rooms} | void | Creates a Clinic with the specified name and number of rooms.(if the rooms are not odd, throws an exception) |
| Add {pet's name} {clinic's name} | boolean | This command should add the given pet in the specified clinic.(true if the operation is successful and false if it isn't). |
| Release {clinic's name} | boolean | This command should release an animal from the specified clinic. (true if the operation is successful and false if it isn't). |
| HasEmptyRooms {clinic's name} | boolean | Returns whether the clinic has any empty rooms.(true if it has and false if it doesn't). |
| Print {clinic's name} | void | This command should print each room in the specified clinic, ordered by room number. |
| Print {clinic's name} {room} | void | Prints on a single line the content of the specified room. |

## Input

On the first line, you will be given an integer **N** - the number of commands you will receive. On each of the next **N** lines, you will receive a command. 

Commands and parameters will always be **correct** ( `Add`, `Release`, `HasEmptyRooms` and `Print` commands will always be passed to **existing** clinics/pets), except for the number of rooms in the **Create Clinic** command which can be any **valid** integer **between 1 and 101**.

## Output

For each command with a boolean **return** type received through the input, you should print its return value on a **separate** line. 

In case of a method **throwing** an **exception** (such as trying to create a clinic with even number of rooms or trying to add a pet that doesn't exist) you should **catch** the exceptions and instead, print `Invalid Operation!`. 

The Print command with a clinic and a room should print information for that room in the format **specified** above. 

The Print command with only a clinic should print information **for each** room in the clinic in **order** of their numbers.

## Constraints

- The number of commands **N** - will be a valid integer **between** [1 ... 1000], no need to check it explicitly.
- **Pet names** , **Clinic names** , and **kind** will be strings consisting only of alphabetical characters with length **between** [1 ... 50] characters.
- **Pet age** will be a positive integer **between** [1 ... 100].
- **Clinic rooms** will be a positive integer **between** [1 ... 101].
- **Room number** in a **Print** command will always be **between 1** and the **number of rooms** in that Clinic.
- Input will consist **only** of **correct commands** and they will **always** have the correct type of parameters.

The Flexible Box Module - **flexbox**, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer **space distribution** between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

The Flexbox is the easiest way to make a flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Flexbox is a method for laying out items in **rows** or **columns**.

Items flex to **fill** additional space and **shrink** to fit into smaller spaces.

The following simple layout requirements are either **difficult** or **impossible** to achieve with float and positioning, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:
* Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent;
* Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available;
* Making all columns in a multiple-column layouts adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

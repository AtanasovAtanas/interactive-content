# List Definition and Usage

# Definition

A list is a **collection** which is **ordered** and **changeable**. Lists are useful for **preserving** a sequence of **data** and **iterating** over it. They are enclosed in **square brackets** and the values inside it are **separated by a comma**.
```python
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "cherry"]
```
A **single list** can contain variables of **different data types**, for example integers, strings, etc. Also, **duplicate** values **can** be stored in it.
```python
my_list = ["string", 2, 3.33, 2]
```
The values in a list are called **elements**. Lists are the **basis** for other abstract data types like **ques**, **stacks** and their variations.

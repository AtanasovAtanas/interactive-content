# List Definition and Usage

# Definition

You already know how to store **single data in one variable**. **Lists** allow us to store **multiple data**, again, in only **one variable**.

A list is a **collection** which is **ordered** and **changeable**.

Lists are useful for **preserving** a sequence of **data** and **iterating** over it.

They are enclosed in **square brackets** and the values inside it are **separated by a comma**.

```python
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "cherry"]
```

A **single list** can contain variables of **different data types**, for example integers, strings, etc.

Also, **duplicate** values **can** be stored in it.

```python
my_list = ["string", 2, 3.33, 2]
```

The values in a list are called **elements**.

Imagine a **train** which has **wagons**, and each wagon - **passengers**.

Now imagine this as a **list of integers**, **each element** represent a **wagon** and its **value** is the **passengers**.

Take a look at this picture:

There are **7 wagons** (**elements**). Each has **passengers** (**a value**). `[3, 4, 10, 7, 5, 0, 6]`

Lists are the **basis** for other abstract data types like **ques**, **stacks** and their variations.

You are going to learn about these structures in the following courses.

# Real-Life Example: Football team

You favorite footbal team consists of 11 players. Each player has a number, which is unique and there are not two players in one team with same numbers.

An array is like a footbal team, it has **name**, it has **fixed size** \(footbal team has 11 players\), it has **unique indexes** \(there are not two players in one team with same numbers\), all elements in the array are of the **same type** \(like in a footbal team, so far only a human can play footbal\).

Today we're going to do in depth learning about arrays in Java. 

We're going to learn how to create arrays, how to manipulate arrays, how perform operation on arrays and many more.

# Definition

You already know how to store single data in one variable. Arrays allow us to store multiple data, again, in only one variable.

Arrays are useful for preserving a sequence of data and iterating over it.

They are enclosed in curly brackets and the values inside it are separated by a comma.

``` java
String[] days = { "apple", "pear", "cherry" };
```

A single array can contain duplicate values.

```Java
int[] numbers = { 1, 1, 2, 4, 5 };
```
The values in a array are called elements.

Imagine a train which has wagons, and each wagon - passengers.

Now imagine this as an array of integers, each element represent a wagon and its value is the passengers.

Take a look at this picture:

There are **7 wagons (elements)**. Each has **passengers (a value)**. \{3, 4, 10, 7, 5, 0, 6\}

Arrays are the **basis** for other abstract data types like **list**, **stack**, **queue**.

You are going to learn about these structures in the following courses.

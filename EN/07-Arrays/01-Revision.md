## Integer types

Stores whole numbers, positive or negative \(such as 123 or -456\), without decimals.

Valid integer types: **byte**, **short**, **int** and **long**, which type you should use depends on the numeric value.

## Floating point types

Stores a numbers, positive or negative \(such as -9.99 or 3.14515\), with a decimal.

Valid floating point type: **float**, **double**.

Floating-point types also:

* Have range and precision depending on the memory used.
* Sometimes behave abnormally in the calculations.
* May hold very small and very big valueslike **0.00000000000001** and **100000000000000000000000000.0**.

## Type Conversion

When you assign value of one data type to another, the two types might not be compatible with each other.

If the data types are compatible, then Java will perform the conversion automatically known as Automatic Type Conversion and if not then they need to be casted or converted explicitly. 

There are two types of conversion **Widening Casting** and **Narrowing Casting**.

## Boolean Type

A boolean data type is declared with the **boolean** keyword and can only take the values **true** or **false**.

## Strings

Strings are used for storing text.

A **String** variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes and has a default value **null** (no value).

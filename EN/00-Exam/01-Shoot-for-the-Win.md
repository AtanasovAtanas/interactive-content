## Description
Write a program that helps you keep track of your **shot targets**.

You will receive **a sequence with integers**, separated by single space, representing targets and their value.

Afterward, you will be receiving indices until the `End` command is given and you need to print the **targets** and the **count of shot targets**.

Every time you receive an **index**, you need to shoot the target on that index, **if it is possible**.

Every time you **shoot a target**, its value becomes **-1 and it is considered shot**.

Along with that you also need to **Reduce** all the other **targets**, which have **greater values** than your **current** target, **with its value**.

All the **targets**, which **have less than or equal** value to the **shot target**, you need to **increase with its value**.

**Keep in mind that you can't shoot a target, which is already shot**.

**You also can't increase or reduce a target, which is considered shot**.

When you receive the `End` command, print the targets in their current state and the count of shot targets in the following format:

`Shot targets: {count} -> {target1} {target2}â€¦ {targetn}`

## Input \/ Constraints

- On the **first line** of input, you will receive a **sequence** of **integers**, **separated** by a **single space** â€“ **the target sequence**.

- On the **next lines**, until the `End` command you be receiving **integers** each on a single line â€“ **the index of the target to be shot**.

## Output

- The format of the output is described above in the problem description.


## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 30 30 12 60 54 66 | Shot targets: 4 -\> -1 120 -1 66 -1 -1 |
| 5 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 0 |  |
| End |  |

### Comments

First we shoot target on **index 0**.

It becomes **equal to -1** and we start going through the rest of the targets.

Since `50` is more than `24`, we reduce it to `26` and `36` to `12` and `70` to `46`.

The sequence looks like that:
`-1 26 12 46`

The next index is **invalid**, so we don't do anything.

Index 3 is **valid** and after the operations our sequence should look like that:
`-1 72 58 -1`

Then we take the **first index** with value `72` and our sequence looks like that:
`-1 -1 130 -1`

Then we print the result after the `End` command.

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 24 50 36 70 | Shot targets: 4 -\> -1 120 -1 66 -1 -1 |
| 0 |  |  
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 1 |  |
| End |  |

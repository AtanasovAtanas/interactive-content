# Statements
The **actions** that a program takes, are expressed as **statements**. 

Python supports several different kinds of statements and here are a few of them:
  * **Declaration statements** - declare local variables and constants, which in Python isn't required
  * **Expression statements** - evaluate expressions
  * **Selection statements** - select one of a number of possible statements
  * **Iteration statements** - execute repeatedly an embedded statement
  * **Jump statements** - transfer control
  
Common actions include:
- **Initializing**
  ```python
  counter = 1
  ```

- **Printing** a value
  ```python 
  print(counter)
  ```

- **Modifying** a value
  ```python
  counter+=1
  ```
  
  ```python
  sum = a + b
  ```

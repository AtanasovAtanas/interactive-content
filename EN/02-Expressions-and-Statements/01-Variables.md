# Variables
In programming, each **variable** stores a certain value of a particular type. 

For example, data types can be: number, letter, text (string), date, color, image, list and others. Here are some examples of data types:
* int: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, …
* float: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
* str (text and symbols): 'a', "Hello", "Python", '@', 'X', …
* bool (boolean): `True`, `False`

You can also imagine that **variables** are containers for data or named areas in the memory and the data that they are storing can be read and changed at any time. 

Basically **variables** provide means for:
  * **Storing** data
  * **Retrieving** stored data
  * **Modifying** stored data
  
They are characterized by:
  * name (identifier)
  * type (of the information preserved)
  * value (stored information)

Each of the variables in Python has a name, a type and a value. 

Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it with a value at the same time:
```python
name = "Bob"
employed = True
age = 35
```
If you think of the variables as boxes that hold information, this is how they would look like:

Variables can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - in the execution **stack**
  * Dynamic memory - in the **heap**

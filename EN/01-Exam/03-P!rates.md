## Description

Until the `Sail` command is given you will be receiving:

- Cities that you and your crew have targeted, with their **population** and **gold**, separated by `||`.

- If you receive a city which has been already received, you have to increase the population and gold with the given values.

After the `Sail` command, you will start receiving lines of text representing events until the `End` command is given.

Events will be in the following format:

- `Plunder=>{town}=>{people}=>{gold}`:

You have successfully attacked and plundered the town, killing the given number of people and stealing the respective amount of gold. 

For every town you attack print this message:

 `{town} plundered! {gold} gold stolen, {people} citizens killed.`

If any of those two values (population or gold) reaches zero, the town is disbanded.

You need to **remove it** from your collection of targeted cities and print the following message:

`{town} has been wiped off the map!`

There will be no case of receiving more people or gold than there is in the city.

- `Prosper=>{town}=>{gold}`:

There has been a dramatic economic growth in the given city, **increasing its treasury** by the given amount of gold.

The gold amount **can be a negative number, so be careful**.

If a negative amount of gold is given print:

`Gold added cannot be a negative number!`

and ignore the command.

If the given gold is a valid amount, increase the town's gold reserves by the respective amount and print the following message: 

`{gold added} gold added to the city treasury. {town} now has {total gold} gold.`

### Input

- On the first lines, until the `Sail` command, you will be receiving strings representing the cities with their gold and population, separated by `||`

- On the next lines, until the `End` command, you will be receiving strings representing the actions described above, separated by `=>`

### Output

- After receiving the `End` command if there are any existing settlements on your list of targets, you need to print all of them, sorted by their **gold in descending order**, then by their **name in ascending order**, in the following format:

`Ahoy, Captain! There are {count} wealthy settlements to go to:`

`{town1} -> Population: {people} citizens, Gold: {gold} kg`

â€¦

`{townâ€¦n} -> Population: {people} citizens, Gold: {gold} kg`

- If there are no settlements left to plunder, print:

`Ahoy, Captain! All targets have been plundered and destroyed!`

### Constraints

- The initial population and gold of the settlements will be valid, 32-bit integers, will never be negative or exceed the respective limits.

- The town names in the events will always be valid towns that should be on your list.

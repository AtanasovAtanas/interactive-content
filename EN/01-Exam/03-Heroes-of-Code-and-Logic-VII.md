## Description

On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer `n` – the number of heroes that you can choose for your party.

On the next `n` lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their **hit points** and **mana points** separated by empty space in the following format:

`{hero name} {HP} {MP}`

where **HP** stands for hit points and **MP** for mana points

a hero can have a **maximum** of **100 HP** and **200 MP**

After you have successfully picked your heroes, you can start playing the game.

You will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by ` – ` (space dash space), until the `End` command is given.

There are several actions that can be performed by the heroes:

- `CastSpell – {hero name} – {MP needed} – {spell name}`:

If the hero has the required MP, he casts the spell, thus reducing his MP. Print this message: 

`{hero name} has successfully cast {spell name} and now has {mana points left} MP!`

If the hero is unable to cast the spell print:

`{hero name} does not have enough MP to cast {spell name}!`

- `TakeDamage – {hero name} – {damage} – {attacker}`:

Reduce the hero HP by the given damage amount.

If the hero is still alive (his HP is greater than 0) print:

`{hero name} was hit for {damage} HP by {attacker} and now has {current HP} HP left!`

If the hero has died, remove him from your party and print:

`{hero name} has been killed by {attacker}!`

- `Recharge – {hero name} – {amount}`:

The hero increases his MP.

If a command is given that would bring the MP of the hero above `200`, MP is increased so that it reaches the maximum.

Print the following message:

`{hero name} recharged for {amount recovered} MP!`

- `Heal – {hero name} – {amount}`:

The hero increases his HP.

If a command is given that would bring the HP of the hero above `100`, HP is increased so that it reaches the maximum.

Print the following message:

- `{hero name} healed for {amount recovered} HP!`

### Input

- On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer `n`

- On the next `n` lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their **hit points** and **mana points** separated by empty space in the following format

- You will be receiving different **commands**, each on a new line, separated by ` – ` (space dash space ), until the `End` command is given

### Output

- Print all members of your party who are **still alive**, sorted by their **HP in descending order**, then by their **name in ascending order**, in the following format (their HP/MP need to be indented 2 spaces):

`{hero name}`

`HP: {current HP}`

`MP: {current MP}`

`...`

### Constraints

- The starting HP\/MP of the heroes will be valid, 32-bit integers, will never be negative, or exceed the respective limits.

- The HP\/MP amounts in the commands will never be negative.

- The hero names in the commands will always be valid members of your party. No need to check that explicitly

|  |  |

### Comments

`Heal` – SirMullich healed for 30 HP due to the HP max limit.

`Recharge` – Adela recharged for 50 MP due to the MP max limit.

`CastSpell` – Tyris does not have enough MP to cast the spell.

`TakeDamage` – Tyris`s HP is reduced by 99, thus becoming -5, which means that he is dead.

`TakeDamage` – Ivor`s HP is now -2, so he is dead too.

After the `End` command we print the remaining living heroes, sorted by their HP in reverse order.

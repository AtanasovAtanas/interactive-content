# Workshop: Custom Linked List

## Overview
Write a program that reads **N integers** from the console and **reverses them using a stack**.

Use the **ArrayDeque\&lt;Integer\&gt;** class.

Just put the input numbers in the stack and pop them.

## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 | 5 4 3 2 1 |


| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |

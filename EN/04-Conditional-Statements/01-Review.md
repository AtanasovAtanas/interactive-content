# Variables
In programming **data** is stored in **variables**
  * Variables store data in a piece of the memory
  * Variable read: retrieve the stored data
  * Variable write: modify the stored information

```py live
age = 5
age = age + 1
print(age)
```
# Data Types in Python
* Integer number – 5, 0, 120, -250
* Floating-point number – 3.14159, 0.5
* Boolean – True or False
* Text (strings) and symbols (letters) –  'a', "Hello", "Python", '@', 'X'

# Expressions and Statements

## Expressions
**Expressions** are **variables** and **values**, combined with **operators**.

```py
a = b * 2
```
- 2 is a literal value expression
- a = b * 2 is an assignment expression
- b is a variable expression
- b * 2 is an arithmetic expression

## Statements
**Statements** are **commands** or **actions** to be executed.

```py
a = b * 2
```
- Get the current value stored in b
- Multiply that value by 2
- Store the result back into another variable we call a

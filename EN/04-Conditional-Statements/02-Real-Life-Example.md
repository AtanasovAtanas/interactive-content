# Real Life Example: Watering Plants
[image src="https://github.com/AtanasovAtanas/pb-interactive-csharp/blob/master/assets/02-coditional-statements-1.png"/]

Every day we are faced with decisions, which we make based on conditions that may or may not depend on us.

Let's imagine the following daily situation:

You have some plants in the garden that need watering. 

Depending on the weather outside, you could decide to water them or not.

**If** it is raining:

  * I shall skip watering the plants in the garden

**Else**:

  * I will have to water them

This particular situation only has two options to choose from, but in real life, as well as in programming, you could have multiple.

Here is some pseudocode so that you can understand the concept of conditional statements when it comes to writing code:

```
if humidity is greater than 90%
  Don't water the plants
else
  Water the plants
```

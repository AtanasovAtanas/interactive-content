# Numerals Systems

**Numeral systems** are the ones used by humans and computers to **write sequences using digits**:

- The **decimal system** that is used everyday.

- The **binary system** which is native to computer systems used to represent numbers and data with bits, 

- The **hexadecimal numeral system** and its power to write large binary **numbers** in just a few digits. 

It is possible to convert numbers **from given numeral system to another**.

In computer science specific numeral systems are of big importance: **the positional numeral systems**. In the positional numeral systems the **value** of each digit depends on its **position**. In the **integer numbers**, the digits on the left have bigger weight than the digits, staying on the right.

Positional numeral systems use the so-called **base**, that specifies how many digits are used to represent a number. 

For example: 

- The **decimal system** uses **10 digits**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. 

- The **binary system** uses only **two digits**: `1` and `0`. 

- The **hexadecimal system** uses **16 digits**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 30 | 111110 | 1E |
| 45 | 101101 | 2D |
| 60 | 111100 | 3C |


Each **position** in a decimal number corresponds to a certain **power of 10**. 

``` java no template
401 = 4 * 10 ^ 2 + 0 * 10 ^ 1 + 1 * 10 ^ 0 = 
    = 4 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 1 * 1 = 
    = 400 + 0 + 1 =
    = 401
```

# What is a Bit?

The bits (zero or one) and their fundamental importance in computer science

The **units of measuring** data (bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and so on) and their role in computing and in the digital world.

Bits: these very small portions of data (ones and zeroes), used to represent numbers, text and anything else in the digital world.

Bits are the **smallest units of data** used in computing.

A **bit** is a **single unit of data**, which takes only two possible values: either `0` or `1`.

One bit can store anything, which has **two separate states**:

- Logical values (`true` of `false`), for example "is the registration open now" or "it is closed".

- Algebraic signs (`+` or `-`), for example positive or negative number.

- Activation states (`on` or `off`), for example "the lights are switched on" or "the lights are switched off".

In the **computer memory** bits don't stay alone. They are organized in sequences of **8 bits**, called **bytes** (or sometimes **octets**). These are the machine "words". 

Some machines use 8-bit words, others use 16-bit words, while others use 32-bit words, but usually bits in memory are accessed in groups (bytes in most systems). 
This is the reason why the capacity of computer memory is measured in bytes and megabytes (not in bits and megabits).

There are several **units for measuring** data in the computer science: bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.

- **Bits** hold a single value (`0` or `1`), representing a bit of data (a very small portion). The bit is the **smallest data unit** in computing.

- **Bytes** (also know as octets) consist of **8 bits**. These 8-bit groups are the **smallest addressable units** in the computer memory (at least for most computers). The **microprocessor** (the so-called CPU) can read and write data from the memory as bytes or sequences of bytes but cannot directly read fractions of a byte (like 3 bits or 7 bits).

- **Kilobytes** (denoted by **KB** or **KiB**) consist of **1024 bytes** (in the field of information technologies). In some contexts **1 kilobyte** can mean 1000 bytes (not 1024), which comes from the widely accepted prefix **"kilo"**, which means 1000. For example, the hard-drive manufacturers use 1000-based kilobytes to measure the hard drive capacity, this means that hard drives are smaller than their label in the shop says. For example, a short article in the news holds a few kilobytes of text letters and characters.

- **Megabytes** (denoted as **MB**) consist of **1024 kilobytes**, which calculates to **1 048 576 bytes**. For example, a photo taken with your smartphone camera is several megabytes of compressed data, holding the image pixels. 

- **Gigabytes** (denoted as **GB**) consist of **1024 megabytes**. One gigabyte holds **1 073 741 824 bytes**. For example, an hour long video, compressed in Full HD quality takes typically a few gigabytes of storage. 

- **Terabytes** (denoted as **TB**) consist of **1024 gigabytes**. One terabyte holds nearly 1.1 trillion bytes. One terabyte hard drive typically stores a few hundreds of Full HD movies.

- **Petabytes** (denoted as **PB**) consist of **1024 terabytes**. One petabyte holds nearly 1.13 quadrillions of bytes.

Modern data centers provide and manage storage with capacity of multiple petabytes, sometimes multiple exabytes.

The next units after petabyte and exabyte are zettabyte and yottabyte.

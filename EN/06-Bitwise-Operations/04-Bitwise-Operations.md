# Bitwise Operations

**Bitwise operators** and their application in programming: the bitwise `&` (and), the bitwise `|` (or), the bitwise `^` (exclusive or) and the bitwise `~` (not operators). 

It is possible to read and write bits from given integer number using **bit masks** and **bitwise operations**.

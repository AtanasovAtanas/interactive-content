## Description
Somewhere in the future, there is a robotics factory.

The current project is assembly-line robots.

Each robot has a **processing time** , the time it needs to process a product. When a **robot is free** it should **take a product for processing** and log his name, product, and processing start time.

Each robot **processes a product coming from the assembly line**. A **product is coming** from the line **each second** (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]). If a product passes the line and **there is not a free robot** to take it, it should be **queued at the end of the line again**.

The robots are **standing on the line in the order of their appearance**.

## Input

- On the first line, you will get the names of the robots and their processing times in format **&quot;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime&quot;**
- On the second line, you will get the starting time in format **&quot;hh:mm:ss&quot;**
- Next, until the **&quot;End&quot;** command, you will get a product on each line.

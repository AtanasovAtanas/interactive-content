## Description
Mighty battle is coming. 

In the stormy Nether Realms, demons are fighting against each other for supremacy in a duel from which only one will survive. 

Your job, however, is not so exciting. 

You are assigned to **sign in all the participants** in the Nether Realm's mighty battle's demon book, which of course is **sorted alphabetically**. 

A demon's name contains **his health and his damage**. 

The **sum of the ASCII codes of all characters** (excluding numbers (0-9), arithmetic symbols ('+', '-', '*', '/') and **delimiter do**t ('.')) **gives a demon's total health**. 

The **sum of all numbers in his name forms his base damage**. 

Note that you should consider the **plus** '+' and **minus** '-' signs (e.g. +10 is 10 and -10 is -10). 

However, there are **some symbols** ('\*' and '/') that **can further alter the base damage by multiplying or dividing it by 2** (e.g. in the name "m15\*/c-5.0", the base damage is 15 + (-5.0) = 10 and then **you need to multiply it by 2** (e.g. 10 \* 2 = 20) and **then divide it by 2** (e.g. 20 / 2 = 10)). 

So, **multiplication and division are applied only after all numbers are included in the calculation** and in the order they appear in the name. 

You will get **all demons on a single line**, **separated by commas and zero or more blank spaces**. 

Sort them in **alphabetical order and print their names** along their **health and damage**. 

### Input
- The input will be read from the console. 
- The input consists of a single line containing all demon names separated by commas and zero or more spaces in the format:
    - "\{demon name\}, \{demon name\}, â€¦ \{demon name\}"

### Output
- Print all demons sorted by their name in ascending order, each on a separate line in the format:
    - "\{demon name\} - \{health points\} health, \{damage points\} damage"

### Constraints
- A demon's name will contain at least one character
- A demon's name cannot contain blank spaces ' ' or commas ','
- A floating-point number will always have digits before and after its decimal separator
- Number in a demon's name is considered everything that is a valid integer or floating point number (with dot '.' used as separator). 
    - For example, all these are valid numbers: '4', '+4', '-4', '3.5', '+3.5', '-3.5' 

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| M3ph-0.5s-0.5t0.0** | M3ph-0.5s-0.5t0.0** - 524 health, 8.00 damage |

### Comments
- M3ph-0.5s-0.5t0.0**:
    - Health = 'M' + 'p' + 'h' + 's' + 't' = 524 health.
    - Damage = (3 + (-0.5) + (-0.5) + 0.0) * 2 * 2 = 8 damage.

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| M3ph1st0**, Azazel | Azazel - 615 health, 0.00 damage  |
| | M3ph1st0** - 524 health, 16.00 damage |

### Comments
- Azazel: 
    - Health - 'A' + 'z' + 'a' + 'z' + 'e' + 'l' = 615 health. Damage - no digits = 0 damage.
- M3ph1st0**:
    - Health - 'M' + 'p' + 'h' + 's' + 't' = 524 health.
    - Damage - (3 + 1 + 0) * 2 * 2 = 16 damage.

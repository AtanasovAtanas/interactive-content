# What is CSS Box Model?

The **CSS box model** is essentially a **box that wraps** around every HTML element.

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The term **"box model"** is used when talking about design and layout.

CSS box model consists of: 
* **margins** - clears an area **outside** the border. The margin is transparent;
* **borders** - a border that goes **around** the padding and content;
* **padding** - clears an area **between** content and border. The padding is transparent;
* **content** - the **content** of the box (text, imgs, etc.).

**Example:**
```html
div {
    border: 5px solid black;
    padding: 40px;
    margin: 20px;
}
```

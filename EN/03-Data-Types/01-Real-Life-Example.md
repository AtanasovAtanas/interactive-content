# Real-Life Example: Kitchen jars
You can think of variables as kitchen jars. 

You might store coffee in the sugar jar, but these will be different.

Imagine that in each jar you can only store one of the following: salt, sugar, or coffee.

In programming, it is almost the same. 

We use variables that act as jars for different data like numbers, text, symbols, and so on. 

And in the variable, we store numbers, we cannot store text.

[task-description]
## Description
Write a program that reads a list of words from the file **words.txt** (from the Resources - Folder) and finds how many times each of the words is **contained** in another file **text.txt** (from the Resources â€“ Folder).

Matching should be **case-insensitive**.

Write the results in file **results.txt**. 

Sort the words by frequency in **descending order**.

## Guidelines
There is one zipped folder with resources for all exercises, that you need to use. 

Download the resources folder [here](https://mega.nz/file/nIwjSaKQ#KQpc5igeWhk70YWHwrA7QRqqyAySVW5xap-dxwFULgU).

For each exercise submit only the **output** of your program, **not the code**.

## Examples
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| of which The | of - 6 |
|  | which - 2 |
|  | The - 1 |

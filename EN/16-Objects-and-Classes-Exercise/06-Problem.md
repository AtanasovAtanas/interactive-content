## Description
You will receive **an unknown number of lines**.

On each line, you will receive **array with 3 elements**.

The **first** element will be **string** and represents the **name of the person**. 

The **second** element will be a **string** and will represent the **ID of the person**. 

The last element will be an **integer** and represents the **age of the person**.

If you get a person whose **ID you've already received**, then **update** the name and age for that ID with that **of the new person**.

When you receive the **command** "End", **stop** taking input and **print all the people**.

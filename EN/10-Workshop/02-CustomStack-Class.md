## Implement CustomStack Class

### Details about the Structure

The implementation of a **custom stack** is much easier, mostly because you can only execute actions over the last index of the **collection**, plus you can iterate through the collection.

You should be able to create it entirely on your own.

The first thing you can do is to have a clear vision of how you want your structure to work under the provided public functionality.

For example:
- It should hold a **sequence of items in an array**
- The structure should have a **capacity** that **grows twice** when it is filled, **always starting at 4**. 

The **CustomStack** class should have the fields listed below:

- `int[] items` - an array, which will hold all of our elements
- `int size` – holds the **size with real data** of the array
- `final int initialCapacity` – this constant's value will be the initial capacity of the internal array
- `int capacity` – holds the size of the array

# Real-Life Example: Kitchen jars
You can think of variables as kitchen jars. 

You, personally, might store coffee in the sugar jar, but these ones will be different.

Imagine that in each jar you can only store one of the following: salt, sugar, or coffee.

In programming it is almost the same. 

We use variables that act as jars for different data like numbers, text, symbols and so on. 

And in the variable, we store numbers, we cannot store text.

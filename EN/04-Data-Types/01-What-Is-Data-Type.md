# What Is Data Type?
The data type of a value is an attribute that tells what kind of data that value can have.

In other words variables can store data of different types.

In Python we have the following **data types**:

- **Text Type:** `string`;
- **Numeric Types:** `int`, `float`, `complex`;
- **Collections Types:** `list`, `tuple`, `dictionary`, `set`;
- **Boolean Type:**	`bool`;

Examples:
```python
int_number = 50                        #int value
float_number = 50.2	                   #float value
a_str = 'Hello world'                  #str value
is_true = True                         #Boolean
list = [502, 'hello', 50.5, 'h']       #List
dict = {'colour': 'red', 'age':15}     #Dictionary
```
Python is a dynamic programming language, which means you don't need to set a value type when you declare a variable.

Data type is set when you assign a value to a variable.

Any variable can be assigned values of all types and later on you can re-assigned the value:

```python live
current = 11    
print(current)

current = 'python'    
print(current)

current = True    
print(current)
 ```

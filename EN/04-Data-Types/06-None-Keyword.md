# None Keyword

# What Is None?
The `None` keyword is used to define a **null** value, or **no value at all**.

`None` is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. `None` is a datatype of its own (NoneType) and only `None` can be `None`.

There are two ways to check if a variable is `None`

- One way can be performed by using the is keyword
```python live
if null_variable == None:
    print('null_variable is None')
```
- Another is using the `==` syntax
```python live
if null_variable is None:
    print('null_variable is None')
```

# None Keyword

[slide]
# What Is None?

The `None` keyword is used to define a **null** value, or **no value at all**.

`None` is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. `None` is a data type of its own `NoneType` and only `None` can be `None`.

There are two ways to check if a variable is `None`

- One way can be performed by using the `is` keyword

```python
if variable is None:
  # do something
else:
  # do something else
```

- Another is using the `==` syntax

```python
if variable == None:
  # do something
else:
  # do something else
```

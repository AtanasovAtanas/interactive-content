## Description
Write a program that keeps track of the guests that are going to a house party.

On the first input line you are going to **receive how many commands** you are going to have.

On the next lines you are going to receive some of the following inputs: 
-	"\{name\} is going!"
-	"\{name\} is not going!"

If you receive the **first** type of input, you have to **add the person if he/she is not in the list**. 

If **he/she is in the list print** on the console: 
- "\{name\} is already in the list!" 

If you receive the second type of input, you have to remove the person if he/she is in the list. 

If not print: 
- "\{name\} is not in the list!"

**At the end print all the guests. Each on a new line.**

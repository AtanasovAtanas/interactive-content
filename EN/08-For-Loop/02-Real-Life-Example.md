# Real-Life Example: Moving Dishes
Let's imagine you have to load the dishwasher with all of the dishes from the sink.

You know **exactly how many** dishes you are going to move from the sink to the dishwasher before you start this task, because there is a certain number of dirty dishes in the sink.

You **won't stop** loading the dishwasher **until** you've completed that task **for all** the dirty dishes.

So, you'll pick up the **first one** and put it in the dishwasher - that's one item.

Then you'll pick up the **second one** and put it in the dishwasher and continue **repeating the same action** until you put all dirty dishes in the dishwasher.

The whole idea is that you have to repeat a particular action a **count** of times, which **you know before starting** the process.

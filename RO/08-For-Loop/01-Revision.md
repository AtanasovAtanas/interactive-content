# Revision 
Before proceeding ahead, let's remind ourselves about the program concepts and techniques that we have learned in the last session.

# Nested Conditions
```py
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # body
    else:
        # body
```

# Complex Conditions with `and,` `or`, `not` and `()`
```py
if (x == left or x == right) and y >= top and y <= bottom:
    print(â€¦)
```

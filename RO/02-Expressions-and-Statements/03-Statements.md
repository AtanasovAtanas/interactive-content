# Statements
The **actions** that a program takes, are expressed as **statements**. 

Java supports several different kinds of statements and here are a few of them:
  * **Declaration statements** - declare local variables and constants
  * **Expression statements** - evaluate expressions
  * **Selection statements** - select one of a number of possible statements
  * **Iteration statements** - execute repeatedly an embedded statement
  * **Jump statements** - transfer control
  
Common actions include:
-  **Declaring** a variable
  Declaring a variable means **defining** its **type**.
  ```java
  int counter;
  ```
-  **Assigning** a value
  After you declare a variable, you can assign a value to a variable. 
  
  Assigning a value to a variable means **storing** a **value** to a variable.
  ```java
  counter = 1;
  ```

- Declaring + **initializing**
  ```java
  int counter = 1;
  ```

- **Printing** a value
  ```java
  System.out.println(counter);
  ```

- **Modifying** a value
  ```java
  counter++;
  ```
  
  ```java
  sum = a + b;
  ```

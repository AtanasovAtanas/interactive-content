# Data Types
In Python we can use data types to define variables as follows:
* **int** - integer number 
* **float** - real number
* **str** - string and chars 
* **bool** - boolean

Once a variable is defined, it can change its value many times.

Here is how we can declare variables of different types:
```python
a = 5
text = "Some text"
letter = 'A'
f = 4.2
```

In Python data types are **dynamic**.

Unlike other programming languages such as C# and Java it can change its data type later. 

A single variable can be used to hold different data types
```python
x = 5        # x is Number
x = "John"   # x is String
x = True     # x is Boolean
```

To set a string value to a variable you can use **single** or **double** **quotes**:
```python
first_name = "John" 
last_name = 'Adams'
```
But you cannot use both together:
```python
first_name = 'John" 
# this will not work  

```

Data types set ranges of values with similar characteristics.

The are characterized by:
  * **Name** - E.g. bool, int, string, DateTime
  * **Size** (memory usage) - Example: 4 bytes
  * **Default value** - Example: 0

# Naming Conventions
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of **rules** for choosing the name to be used for variables.

In Python the convention for naming variables is ***"Snake-case"***. 

There are other naming conventions which are used in different languages such as pascal case, camel case. 

**Snake-case** is another naming convention, which separates words with:
* one underscore character (_)
* no spaces
* each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound
* the first letter either upper or lowercase:
```python
users_count
first_name
```

**Camel case** combines words by:
* capitalizing all words following the first word
* removing the space:
```python
userLoginCount
```

**Pascal case** combines words by:
* capitalizing each word along with the first one
* removing the space:
```python
UserLoginCount
```

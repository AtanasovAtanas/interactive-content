# Simple If Conditions
One of the single most important statements in every programming language is the `if` statement. 

In programming we often **check particular conditions** and perform various actions depending on the result of the check.

This is done by `if` condition, which has the following structure:
```py
if condition:
  # condition body
```

# Example: Weather
Here if the condition of rainy weather evaluates to **true**, then the body of the statement gets executed.
```py
weather = input()

if weather == "rainy":
    print("Take an umbrella!")
```

# Indentation
Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces **\{** **\}** to define a block of code
  * **Python** uses indentation

A code block (body of a function, loop, if statement, etc.) **starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line**

The amount of indentation is up to you, but it **must be consistent** throughout that block
  * Generally **four whitespaces** are used for indentation and is preferred over tabs 

The enforcement of indentation in **Python** makes the code look neat and clean
  * This results into **Python** programs that look **similar and consistent**

Here is an example:
```python
name = "John"
if name == "John": 
  print(name)
```

Indentation **can be ignored** in line continuation, **but it's a good idea to always indent**, because it makes the code more readable

For example:
```python
if True:
    print('Hello')
    a = 5
```

and

```python
if True: print('Hello'); a = 5
```

Both are valid and do the same thing, but the **former style is clearer and more readable**

Incorrect indentation will result into **`IndentationError`**:
```python
   name = "John"
if name == "John": 
  print(name)
# Indentation Error
```

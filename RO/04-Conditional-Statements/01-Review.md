# Variables
In programming **data** is stored in **variables**

  * Variables store data in a piece of the memory
  * Variable read: retrieve the stored data
  * Variable write: modify the stored information

```py live
age = 5
age = age + 1
print(age)
```
# Data Types in Python
* Integer number – 5, 0, 120, -250

* Floating-point number – 3.14159, 0.5

* Boolean – True or False

* Text (strings) and symbols (letters) –  'a', "Hello", "Python", '@', 'X'

# Expressions and Statements
**Expressions** == **variables** and **values**, combined with **operators**

```py
a = b * 2
# 2 is a literal value expression
# a = b * 2 is an assignment expression
# b is a variable expression
# b * 2 is an arithmetic expression
```

Statements - Commands / actions to be executed

```py
a = b * 2
# Get the current value stored in b
# Multiply that value by 2
# Store the result back into another variable we call a
```

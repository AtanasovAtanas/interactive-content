# Summary
First, we have learned what is programming – giving commands, written in a computer language, which the machine understands and is able to execute. 
```py live
print('Hello SoftUni')
```

We understood what a computer program is – it represents a sequence of commands, arranged one after another.
```py live
# Square Area Calculator
side = int(input())
area = side * side
print("Area = ", area)
```

We got familiar with the language for programming **Python** on a base level and how to create simple console applications with Pycharm.

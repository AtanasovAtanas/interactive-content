# Programming Languages
A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for giving commands that we want the computer to **read**, **process** and **execute**.

Using programming languages, we write **sequences of commands** (programs), which define what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. 

These languages differ in their philosophy, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**.

# Compilers
The **compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks** the text of the program for **errors**. 

Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the computer expects it.

# Interpreters
The **interpreter** is "a **program for executing programs**", written in some programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program **one after another**, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The Python Language
**Python** is modern, general purpose programming language. 

Extremely versatile. You can create everything: from desktop, mobile and web applications to complex scientific and numeric applications, online services and back-end functionality. 

The demand for Python developers is currently among the highest because of the technical level. This ensures professional realization once you have the skills you need! Python is used by about **8.2 million** programmers around the world (according to SlashData). 

Right now Python is one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**. 
* It is easy to learn Python through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**. 

Combines **multi-paradigm**, **object-oriented** and **functional programming** with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# Python Execution
As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to obtain certain result.

A Python program is written in a text format, and the text of the program is called a **source code**. 

The interpreter executes the code line by line. This means that if we have an error in our code, we will find it out after we start our program and we reach the wrong line of code.

The process of **compilation** of the code before its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++. 

With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.

# Python Interpreter
An interpreter is a program that **reads** and **executes** code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts.

If we don't use an interpreter the source code is only a plain text file and not an executable program. 

In order to write code in Python, you will need to download **Python**

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest available version:

After you download and install Python, you can **start** it.

If you are using Windows OS, the terminal will be opened, which looks like this:

And now we can type in commands. The most simple example is calculating some numbers:

## Description
40 % of the wine-making crop is allocated from a vineyard of X square meters. 

From 1 square meter vineyard are earn **Y kilos of grapes**. 

For 1 liter of wine are needed **2.5 kg grapes**. 

The desired amount of wine for sale is **Z liters**. 

Write a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether this quantity is enough. 
- If sufficient, the remainder is divided equally between the workers of the vineyard.

## Input
The entrance is read from the console and consists of exactly 4 rows:
- **X sq. m is the vineyard** - integer in range \[10 … 5000\]
- **Y grapes for one sq. m** - floating-point number in range \[0.00 … 10.00\]
- **Z need liters of wine** - integer in range \[10 … 600\]
- **Number of workers** - integer in range \[1 … 20\]

## Output
The following should be printed on the console: 
-  If the wine produced is less than necessary:
    - "It will be a tough winter! More \{unattainable wine\} liters wine needed."
        - The result must be rounded to a lower integer
- If the wine produced is more than or equal to necessary:
    - "Good harvest this year! Total wine: \{Total wine\} liters."
        - The result must be rounded to a lower integer
    -  "\{remaining wine\} liters left -> \{wine for 1 worker\} liters per person."
        - Both results must be rounded to the higher integer

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 650 | Good harvest this year! Total wine: 208 liters. |
| 2 | 33 liters left -> 11 liters per person. |
| 175 | |
| 3 | |

### Comments
- Total Grapes: 650 \* 2 = 1300
- Wine = 40% \* 1300/2.5 = 208
- 208 > 175 
- 208 \- 175 = 33 liters remain \-> 11 liters per person

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- |  --- |
| 1020 | It will be a tough winter! More 180 liters wine needed.|
| 1.5 | |
| 425 | |
| 4 | |

# While Loop
A while loop is used to repeat a block of code when we don't know the count of iterations

```python
n = int(input())
while n % 2 != 0:
  n = int(input())
print(n)
```

# Break Operator
Used for prematurely **exiting** the loop

Can only be executed from the loop's **body**

When it is executed, the code inside the loop's body after it **is skipped** and does not execute

# Infinite While Loop
```python
number = 1
command = "Add"
while command != "END"
  print(number)
# Always evaluated to True
```

```python
while True:
  # Commands
 ```

# Real-Life Example: Clock
Imagine the current time is exactly 12:00 AM. 

Our minutes will gradually increase by one until they reach 59. 

Once they get to 60, the hours will be incremented by 1 and the minutes will be reset back to zero. 

We can represent this process using for loops, and more importantly, why would we even need more than one for-loop to simulate how a simple clock works

# Pseudocode
```
for h which is in range from 0 to 23
    for m which is in range from 0 to 59
        print h and m in format similar to the clock
```
